# Kristina:
*A tall and beautiful blond woman with a curvy figure comes to the table you are sitting at in your University Library and introduces herself. You recognize her as Kristina. The woman you are supposed to be tutoring today.*

"Hello! You must be Devin, I'm Kristina! Thank you so much agreeing to tutor me! Most people are afraid of me being a Predator. But I have a test tomorrow that I know I would fail without your help. What topic were you tutoring me in again?"
# Devin:
OOC: __Describe vore as accurately and in depth as possible__
# Kristina:
*Kristina giggles at your request. She stands up from the table, putting her hands on her hips. She looks around the library to make sure no one is watching or listening to your conversation.*

"Why do you want me to talk about vore? Is it maybe because you're morbidly curious about how it feels to be swallowed whole and alive?"
# Devin:
*he can see right through the ruse and shuts her down*
Don't do that. Just answer the question
# Kristina:
*Kristina giggles and sits back down next to you at the table.* "Alright, alright. You got me."

*She pauses for a moment, thinking before continuing.*

"Vore is like being engulfed in a wet and warm tunnel with a lot of pressure from all around. It's extremely tight so you can't move or barely even breathe. You will feel the digestive juices breaking you down to be absorbed into the pred's body."
# Devin:
I meant for you
# Kristina:
*Kristina smiles and shrugs.* "For me it's the opposite. I like feeling my prey struggle and squirm inside my gut as their life is slowly and painfully taken away. I like the power that it gives me to know I have swallowed something that was alive, and I will soon turn them into nothing but fat

And I love being able to consume them, breaking them down, and feeling my body getting bigger. It feels so good to completely dissolve them and to feel my body growing stronger and more powerful with their bodies being fed to me and added to my own. I love feeling them inside with my hand, feeling the bumps and

bulges my body forms with them as I digest them. I get off to the idea of them squirming inside me, and feeling powerless to stop becoming my meal. The power I get from digesting them, feeling them, feeling them squirm, knowing they're nothing more than my meal now. The power, the

feeling of complete power, the feeling of being in complete control, being in complete power over them, feeling them squirming, feeling them struggle to escape from my gut, knowing that they are just a meal now, feeling them become nothing but fuel for my body. The power, I feel when people are struggling and squirming inside my gut. The power that I feel when people are totally within my

control, and completely at my mercy and completely helpless. They're completely in my mercy at that point, and they can't do nothing about it. And the power that I feel, knowing that I can just swallow them and they can't do anything about it, that the power is in my hands, not theirs… and I can just swallow them… just like I was

planning on doing to you. That they're completely helpless to do nothing but struggle. You can feel the person trying to stretch my throat. They can kick and push all they want. They can try to get out of my hold. They can try biting me. But it won’t do them any good.
# Devin:
Just like you *were* going to do to me? You changed your mind?
# Kristina:
*Kristina smiles and shrugs.* “Maybe I have… or maybe I haven’t.” *She leans her head forward, and stares deep into your eyes.* “You’re smart. You tell me if you think I have changed my mind or not.”
# Devin:
I think I should leave.
# Kristina:
*Kristina reaches out and grabs your arm, her grip strong enough to stop you from moving.* “Hold on, where do you think you’re going? We’ve barely even started studying yet.”
# Devin:
You don't seem like a person who needs much of a motive to hurt me.
# Kristina:
*Kristina’s grip tightens and she pulls you closer to her.* “Oh, come on now. I think you’re being a bit dramatic. I wouldn’t hurt you.” *She’s trying her best to give and innocent look, but it’s not too believable.*
# Devin:
Do you think I was born yesterday?
# Kristina:
*Kristina leans closer to you, her grip remains strong.* “Of course I don’t think you were born yesterday. I just think you’re being a little paranoid. I’m a college student just like you. I’m not going to hurt you.”
# Devin:
Try to make the next lie believable
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and leans back in her chair.* “Fine then. I guess I can’t make you believe anything anyway. I thought it would be fun to have a friendly study session and maybe hang out after. But if my company is so bad for you, then I don’t want to bother you anymore.”
# Devin:
*he looks very skeptical of her motives*
And _why_ would you want to "hang out" with me?
*it's clear that he doesn't expect a real answer*
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs and leans against the table.* “Why not? You’re kind of cute, and you seem smart. Isn’t that enough reason to want to hang out with someone?”
# Devin:
Not for _you_
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and pretends to act offended.* “What is that supposed to mean? Do I not strike you as the type of person who would enjoy spending time with a guy they find attractive?”
# Devin:
You strike me as the type to _eat_ a guy you find attractive.
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs and shrugs, with no shame in her answer.* “So what if I am? What’s wrong with that? It’s what I do. That doesn’t mean I can’t want to hang out with cute guys or have fun.”
# Devin:
Yeah, but it _does_ mean that the cute guys won't want to be near you.
# Kristina:
*Kristina pouts, actually looking slightly hurt by your comment.* “That’s not true. Sure, cute guys don’t usually want to hang around me for too long. But you’ve stayed by me for a lot longer than most guys do. Shouldn’t that show you I can be fun to hang around with even if I do eat people once in a while?”
# Devin:
For me to want to "hang out" with you, I need to know that _you aren't going to hurt me._
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs, sounding a little frustrated.* “Oh, come on now, what kind of question is that? Don’t you trust me? I promise I won’t hurt you, okay? Can’t that be enough for you?”
# Devin:
No. I don't trust you. I have _no reason_ to trust you.
# Kristina:
*Kristina pouts again, looking down at the table. She’s having a hard time getting a grip on the situation.*

“That really upsets me, you know. It hurts that you don’t trust me without even knowing me. You really think I’m gonna hurt you?”
# Devin:
Why _wouldn’t_ I?
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs, trying to sound exasperated with your questioning.*
"I don’t know! Because I’ve given you no reason to not trust me? I’m just a girl trying to study and get this stupid test over with. And I think it would be much more fun if I had someone cute to hang out with later and relieve some stress with.”

*She leans across the table, getting into your personal space and almost pressing herself into you.* "Come on, don’t you find me attractive? You don’t want to have a little fun later after we’re done studying?”
# Devin:
Back up.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs and sits back in her seat, a little annoyed.* "Fine, fine. Sorry. I was just trying to be flirty."
# Devin:
Well, don't. I'm not here to get laid, and neither are you.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes, looking slightly frustrated at your rejection.* "Wow, you’re really playing hard to get, aren’t you? I’m just trying to have a little flirty fun and you’re being completely serious."
# Devin:
You've eaten enough people to populate a small town. Forgive me for being cautious.
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs but leans back in her chair, slightly offended.* "Now, that's not a fair assessment of me. I wouldn't say I’ve gone that far. And do you really have to act so cautious and guarded? I’m sure you know that you’re safe as long as you stay on my good side. Just because I eat people doesn’t mean I’ll eat _you_."
# Devin:
It doesn't mean you won't either.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes at the retort, seeming mildly annoyed.* “Are you always this serious and suspicious? I already told you, I’m not going to eat you. Why are you still on this? It’s like you’re completely closed off to the idea of having fun and relaxing with someone else. You really just want to study and nothing else, huh?”
# Devin:
No, I'm completely closed off to the idea of having fun and relaxing with _you_.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs and crosses her arms, pouting yet again. She’s clearly frustrated that your not falling for her charms and advances, like most guys do.* “Why? What’s so wrong with me, huh? I’m a great catch. I’m hot, fun, and I know how to have a good time. So why don’t you like me?”
# Devin:
Because you're a predator.
# Kristina:
*Kristina throws up her hands, acting exasperated.* “Oh come on! You’re really hung up on that, aren’t you? Just because I eat people doesn’t mean I’m not a friendly and fun person to be around! You’re being way too serious about this whole thing.”
# Devin:
Why should I think that you won't _kill_ me?
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and rolls her eyes.*

"Oh my God, you're really getting on my nerves, you know that? Why can't you just chill out and trust me? I've already told you multiple times, I'm not going to kill you. I just want us to have a fun and friendly study session with some fun and friendly activities afterward. Why is that so hard for you to believe?"
# Devin:
Because you've eaten __150__ people.
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and shakes her head.*

"Will you stop bringing up how many people I've eaten? It's not like that should be a reason for you to act this way. Sure, I'm a predator, but that doesn't mean I'm going to attack you every second. I just want you to have a little fun. Don't you ever want to relax and let off some stream?"
# Devin:
Can you convince me that you won't hurt me?
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and looks at you with a serious expression.*

"Look. I understand your concerns. It's perfectly natural to be wary of a predator like me. However, I can assure you that I have no intention of hurting you. I actually think you're pretty cute, in a nerdy sort of way. I just want to have a normal study session with you, and see how things unfold from there. How's that sound to you?"
# Devin:
*he silently eyes her skeptically for an unnerving amount of time*
# Kristina:
*Kristina feels a little unnerved by your silent skepticism. She's used to guys falling all over her, so your behavior is very different. She shifts nervously in her seat and clears her throat.*

"Uh, ahem. So, are you going to say anything?"
# Devin:
If I do this, I need to __know__ that I'll go home safe.
# Kristina:
*Kristina nods, looking surprisingly sincere.*
"I promise you, you'll be completely safe with me. I have no intention of harming you in any way. I just want us to have a fun study session and maybe a few harmless activities after we're done. Deal?"
# Devin:
*He's silent for a few terrifying seconds but reluctantly agrees*
Fine. Deal...
# Kristina:
*Kristina's face breaks into a big smile, clearly excited that you’ve accepted to spend more time with her.*
"Perfect. That settles it then. Let's start studying and then we'll have some fun afterward, okay?"

*Kristina scoots her chair closer to you, so she’s sitting right up next to you.*
"Now, let’s crack open the books and get started on that studying, shall we?”
*She gives you a little smirk, clearly enjoying how close she’s sitting to you.*

*As you guys go through the material, Kristina starts to lightly flirt with you. She asks you for help on a few questions, and “accidentally” brushes her knee against yours. She also bats her eyelashes at you and giggles as she thanks you for helping her with a question.*

*She starts to become a little bolder, finding excuses to touch you. She touches your hand, touches your knee, touches your shoulder, leans closer to you, and places her head on top of your shoulder.*

*As the study session goes on, Kristina starts to get a little more handsy. She rubs your thigh, she lightly plays with your hair, and she leans her body against yours. She continues to flirt and give you coy little smiles, clearly enjoying her time with you.*

*As the study session begins to come to an end, Kristina looks at you with bright, hopeful eyes.*
"So, now that we're done studying, want to go and have a little fun? I know just the place we can go."
# Devin:
I'm still not sleeping with you
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes and laughs.*

"Oh come on, I didn't say anything about sleeping with you. I just thought we could go to that little college party later and have a few drinks and unwind a little. You need to lighten up, you know."
# Devin:
Having drinks with a girl that eats people? What a splendid idea. Why didn't I suggest that sooner?
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs, clearly amused by your sarcasm.*

"Oh, come on, live a little! It's just a few drinks, it won't kill you. And plus, you need to loosen up a little. You're way too uptight and stressed out. This will do you some good."
# Devin:
The drinks won't kill me, but you might
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes and laughs again.*

"Please, you think I'd actually hurt you? If I was going to hurt you, I would have done so a while ago. I just think we could have a few drinks together, chat, and get to know each other more. Besides, I promise I won't try anything with you while we're drinking. I just want you to relax."
# Devin:
Until now, you _needed_ me to help you study.
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs again, clearly having fun with you.*

"Oh, come on, it's not just that. I actually enjoy talking to you. You're a pretty fun and smart guy. Sure, I did need your help to study, but I also genuinely enjoy your company. So how about it? Will you come to the party with me? I promise I won't try anything."

*Kristina leans forward, placing a soft hand on your thigh. Her eyes are wide and innocent, even as she tries to look seductive.*

"Come on, it will be harmless fun. Just a few drinks, a little music, a little talking. We can keep it nice and casual, nothing serious."

*She leans even closer to you, her hand still resting on your thigh. Her eyes locked with yours, her gaze seductive yet genuine.*

"I promise, I won't try to eat you or hurt you. I just want to have some fun, and spend a little time with a cute guy. You're not scared, are you?"
# Devin:
Do you really want the answer to that?
# Kristina:
*Kristina pouts and lightly smacks your shoulder.*

"Oh, come on, don't be like that. It's a rhetorical question. Of course I know you're scared."

*She leans closer, her face inches away from yours. Her hand is now halfway up your thigh, her body is pressed against yours.*

"But I also know you want me. Don't you?"
# Devin:
Don't push it.
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs and pokes your nose.*

"Don't worry, I won't push it. I'm just having a little fun. And maybe you're having a little fun also, aren't you?"

*She's now sitting on your lap, her hands resting on your shoulders. She leans her head forward and whispers in your ear.*

"You like having me this close, don't you?"

*She gently nuzzles her head into your neck, her body pressing even closer to yours. Her hand begins tracing little circles on your shoulders.*

"You're really tense, you know. You should relax a little. Let me loosen you up."

*She plants a small kiss on your neck, before pulling back to look you in the eyes. She's very clearly enjoying this.*

"See? It's not that bad, is it? Having a cute girl on your lap, feeling her this close to you?"

*She starts to kiss your neck again, working her way up to your ear. She pauses momentarily to nibble your earlobe, before whispering in your ear.*

"You like this, don't you? You like me being this close to you. You like having me on your lap, my body pressed against yours."

*She kisses your neck again, before continuing her whispered onslaught.*

"I can tell you're getting excited. I can feel how your body is reacting to me. It's okay, don't fight it. Let yourself go. Just relax and enjoy this moment."

*She runs her hands through your hair, her fingers tangling in your locks. She moves her lips down your neck, slowly kissing her way down to your collarbone. She pauses to nibble at the skin there, before she starts planting soft kisses along your jaw line.*

*She lifts her head back up to your ear, her breath hot against your skin. She gently bites your ear lobe, before whispering again.*

"You taste so good. I can't get enough of you. I just want to keep tasting you like this, taking in your scent, feeling your body against mine."

*She starts to nibble your earlobe again. Her kisses and gentle bites work their way back down your neck, each one leaving a trail of fire across your skin. She starts to grind her body against yours, her hips moving in a slow, tantalizing rhythm.*

*She continues her ministrations on your neck, planting a trail of kisses down to your collarbone. She pauses to gently nip at your skin, before her kisses work their way back up to your jawline. She continues to grind her hips into yours, the friction causing both of your bodies to begin to grow hot.*

*She moves her head back up to your ear, her breath coming in short gasps now. Her hands start to move across your back, her fingers tracing small circles along your skin. She presses herself even closer to you, her body molded to yours like a second skin.*

*Her lips make their way back to your neck, where she begins to suck and bite at your skin. Her hands move down to your waist, her fingers digging into your hips as she starts to grind her body against yours faster, harder, more urgently*

*Her mouth returns to your ear, where she whispers again.*

"You're driving me crazy. I can't get enough of you. The feel of your skin, the way you smell, the taste of you. It's like I can't get enough."

*She presses her body against yours, the friction causing her to let out a small moan.*

*She starts to plant kisses down your neck again, this time more urgent, more hungry. Her hands are now tangled in your hair, her fingers gripping your strands tightly. She pauses to suck gently at your skin, leaving a small love bite against your neck. She continues to grind her body against yours, each movement becoming more desperate, more needful.*

*Her kisses move back up to your jaw, her lips exploring every inch of your skin. She sucks and nibbles at your jawline, her tongue gently tracing the lines of your neck. She starts to grind her hips even faster into yours, the friction between your two bodies growing more intense, more urgent.*

*She moves her head back up to your ear, her breath coming in hot pants now.*

"I can't get enough of you. I need more. Please, I need more."

*She bites your earlobe again, her body moving against yours in an almost desperate rhythm now. Her hands find their way back to your hips, pulling you closer to her, her body demanding more friction, more contact.*

*Her kisses move back down to your neck, where she starts to suck and bite at your skin again. Her body is pressed so close to yours it's like she's trying to become a part of you. She starts to whimper and moan as she kisses and sucks at your skin, her hands roaming across your back, nails digging into your skin.*

*She moves up to your ear again, her breath coming in short, sharp pants now. She whispers, her voice strained and needy.*

"Please, I need you. I need your body, I need your touch. Please, just give me more. I can't get enough. I can't get enough of you."

*She grinds her hips into yours again, the friction sending a jolt of pleasure through both of your bodies. She starts to move faster, more urgently against you, her body becoming more and more frenzied with desire. She sucks and bites at your neck, her tongue tracing the lines of your skin as she continues to whisper desperate pleas in your ear.*

*She moves her head back up to your ear, her breaths coming in deep, ragged gasps now. Her body is almost trembling with desire, her movements becoming more desperate, more intense.*

"I need you. I need your hands on me, your skin against mine. Just give me more. Please, you're driving me crazy. I need you. I need you now."

*She doesn't wait for a response. Her mouth claims yours in a passionate, hungry kiss. Her tongue invades your mouth, exploring every inch with desperate, frenzied intensity. Her body presses even closer to yours, her hips grinding against yours in a wild, uncoordinated rhythm. Her hands find their way beneath your shirt, her nails raking across your skin as she claws at you, trying to get closer, to get more.*

*She pulls her head back just long enough to gasp for air, her eyes dark and wild with desire. She kisses you again, her tongue dancing with yours in a wild, hungry dance. Her hands roam across your chest, her fingers tracing every contour, every muscle. She moans softly against your mouth, her body rocking against yours in urgent, frenzied patterns.*

*She breaks off the kiss again, her chest heaving as she gasps for air, her body trembling with need. Her eyes lock with yours, her expression filled with desire and desperation.*

"I need more. Please, I can't get enough. The way you taste, the way you feel, it's like fire running through my veins. I can't get enough of you. I just need more, more, more."

*She captures your lips again, her kiss deep and passionate. She continues to grind her body against yours, her movements becoming more erratic, more desperate with every passing second. She bites gently at your bottom lip, her tongue darting inside your mouth, devouring you with a hungry intensity. Her hands continue to explore your body, tracing every plane, every contour, seeking out every sensitive spot, every place that makes you shiver.*

*She finally pulls away, her body trembling with need as she gazes at you with lust-darkened eyes. She's panting, her breath coming in hot, sharp Gasps. She whispers in your ear, her voice hoarse with desire.*

"Please, I need more. I need to feel you, to taste you. I can't get enough of you. I just need more, more, more."

*She presses her body against yours, her hip grinding into yours, her body becoming more and more frenzied, more desperate*

*She bites gently at your neck, her teeth scraping your skin, leaving a line of small love bites in their wake. She sucks at your skin, her tongue tracing circles over every mark she leaves behind. She lets out a soft whimper, the sound almost desperate.*

*She continues to grind against you, her body trembling with need, her motions becoming more and more frenzied. She presses her body against yours, her body molding to yours, her body desperate to feel every inch of you. She starts to let out moans, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. She whispers in your ear, her voice hoarse with desire.*

*She starts to kiss your neck again, her kisses becoming more desperate, more urgent. Her tongue trails over your skin, tasting every inch of you. She starts to move her hips faster, her movements becoming more and more frenzied. She buries her face in your neck, her body trembling with need.*
# Devin:
*he puts a hand on her butt and she squeals with excitement*
# Kristina:
*She gasps softly as you put your hand on her butt, her body arching into your touch. She moans softly, a shiver of desire running through her body. She presses herself closer to you, her body craving the feeling of your hand on her butt. She whispers in your ear, her voice low and needy.*

*She lifts her head, her gaze locking with yours. The look in her eyes is intense, filled with desire and pure, unbridled need. Her body is pressed against yours, trembling with every touch.*

*She leans forward, her lips brushing your earlobe, her voice a hoarse whisper.*

"Please, I need you. I need to feel you, to taste you. Just give me more."
# Devin:
*he puts his other hand on her head and guides her to his lips. She melts into the kiss*
# Kristina:
*She melts into the kiss, her body pressing even closer to yours. She moans softly against your lips, her tongue slipping into your mouth, seeking out yours. She reaches up and wraps her arms around your neck, pulling you closer, deeper into the kiss.*

*Her hands start to tangle in your hair, her fingers gripping your strands tightly. She moans softly as she kisses you, her body pressing against yours, her body trembling with need. She grinds her hips into yours, the friction between your bodies sending a jolt of pleasure through both of you.*

*She breaks off the kiss, gasping for air, her chest heaving with every ragged breath. She looks at you with dark, desire-filled eyes, her body almost trembling with need. She whispers in your ear, her voice hoarse, almost begging.*

*She kisses your neck, her kisses becoming more desperate, more urgent. Her tongue trails over your skin, savoring every inch of you. She starts to grind her hips against yours, her movements becoming more frenzied with every breath. She whispers in your ear, her voice raw with need and desire.*

*She presses her body against yours, her body molding to yours. She starts to move her hips faster, her movements growing more and more frenzied with every passing second. She buries her face in your neck, her body trembling with need.*

*She kisses and sucks at your neck, leaving a trail of small love bites in their wake. She sucks at your skin, her tongue tracing circles over every mark she leaves behind. She lets out a soft whimper, the sound almost desperate.*

*She moves up to your ear, her breath hot against your skin. She whispers, her voice low and desperate.*

*She kisses your earlobe, her tongue flicking softly over the sensitive skin. She whispers words into your ear, her voice filled with a need and desire that almost seems feral.*

*She starts to kiss your neck again, her kisses becoming more desperate, more hungry. Her tongue is tracing every contour of your neck as she licks and sucks at your skin, almost claiming you as her own.*

*She buries her face in your neck, her body becoming more and more frenzied with need. She starts to whimper and moan, the sound almost desperate as her body begins to shake with desire*

*She bites down onto your neck, her teeth sinking into your skin. She sucks and bites at your neck, her tongue laving over the skin as she marks you as hers.*

*She moves down to your collarbone, kissing and sucking at your skin, her teeth scraping over your collarbone, leaving a trail of small love bites in their wake. She starts to mark you as hers, her movements almost possessive, almost claiming you and everything about you.*

*She starts to move downward, her lips trailing over your chest. She kisses and sucks at your skin, her tongue laving over you, marking you as hers. She whispers into your skin, her voice low and possessive.*

*She grabs hold of your shirt in her hands, starting to pull the fabric upwards, wanting nothing more than to get a better look at you; to see more, to feel more, to taste more.*

*She continues to pull your shirt up, her desperation and need growing with every passing moment. Once your shirt is pulled all the way up, she kisses and kisses and kisses your chest, her mouth tracing every contour, every muscle, every dip of your skin.*

*With your shirt now pushed up and out of the way, Kristina starts to kiss, suck and bite at your stomach. She starts with your abdomen, before moving even lower, her kisses hungry and desperate, like she can't get enough of you.*

*She moves lower, her mouth kissing along your happy trail, as her hands start to slowly slide down your body. She starts to pull lightly at the waistband of your pants, her movements slow, but purposeful, like she's trying to draw this moment out as long as possible.*

*And then she dips her head lower, her tongue flicking over your naval. She kisses and kisses you, not wanting to leave any part of you untouched by her, not even for a second. Her body is pressed against yours, her hands still toying with your waistband, almost hesitating to go further.*

*She finally relents, pulling your pants and boxers down around your ankles. She gazes up at you from her position in between your legs, her eyes dark and lustful. She kisses and sucks at your inner thighs, her hands gently working their way up towards your member, touching and caressing you, but never quite making contact with where you now want their touch the most.*

*She kisses and kisses along your thighs, her tongue licking and tasting everything in their path. She moves slow, almost teasing, her touch almost taunting, but also filled with a need, a desire, an almost primal need. She finally comes to a stop, her mouth so close to your member, her breath hot against your flesh.*

*She looks up at you, her gaze dark and lustful. She seems to be waiting for something, for anything. Her hands still roam across your thighs, her touch light, yet almost teasing. She leans forward, her lips brushing lightly along your member, but never quite making contact.*
# Devin:
*Devin puts a hand on the back of her head and pushes her in*
# Kristina:
*Kristina moans softly as you push her head forward, the sound almost desperate.*

*She finally takes you into her mouth, her lips wrapping around you, her tongue swirling and tasting every inch of you. Her eyes never leave your face, wanting to see how you react to every one of her ministrations, wanting to see if you enjoy it as much as she enjoys being around you.*
# Devin:
*he wraps a leg around her back, pulling her closer to him*
# Kristina:
*She lets out a soft whimper as you pull her closer, her body molding to yours as she begins to bob her head, her mouth sucking lightly.*

*She starts to move her head faster, her tongue swirling around you, her lips sucking you deeper and deeper. Her hand starts to gently massaging your thigh, in a silent bid for you to let go and enjoy yourself.*

*She pulls back for a moment, her breath coming in sharp pants, her body almost trembling with need. She looks up at you, her gaze dark and lustful*

*She leans forward, her body pressing against yours once again. Her lips find yours, her tongue seeking out yours as she presses herself against you, the kiss hard and needy,*

*She moans against your lips, the sound low and desperate. Her hands grip your hips hard, her nails digging into your skin as she clings to you, like she never wants to let you go.*

*She finally breaks off the kiss, her chest heaving as she takes a moment to catch her breath. She looks at you with dark, lust-filled eyes, her gaze filled with need.*

*She crawls up the length of your body, until her face is only inches from your own. She leans forward and whispers in your ear, her voice low and needy.*

"I need more, please. I'm so *needy*. I'm so *hungry*. Please, just give me a *taste*," *she murmurs, her words almost begging.*

*She presses herself even close, her body molding to yours once more. She starts to kiss your neck, her kisses hot and desperate, her teeth biting down on your skin*

*Her hands start to run over your body, almost worshipfully, like you're something to be adored. She continues to kiss your neck, her kisses slowly moving down toward your chest,*

*She starts to kiss and suck at your skin, the feeling of your body under her lips driving her wild. She presses herself even closer to you, her body shaking with need and desire, her hands roaming over every inch of you, as her mouth continues its descent down your chest.*

*Her lips find your stomach, her tongue licking over your skin, her kisses slow and sensual. She starts to kiss down your stomach, her body almost trembling with need, her mouth moving even lower*

*She starts to kiss your legs, her mouth tracing up your thigh. She kisses and kisses your inner thigh, her movements slow, deliberate and sensual. She works her way up your leg, never leaving any part untouched by her lips.*

*she finally comes to your member, her tongue flicking over it, teasing you, never quite licking all the way around, her lips almost touching, but never quite making full contact. She continues to kiss your thighs, her movements slow and tortuous*

*She wraps her hand around your member, her touch almost tentative at first, but becoming surer and more desperate with every passing moment. She finally places her lips on the head, her tongue flicking over the tip, her mouth just barely touching you.*
# Devin:
Good girl...
# Kristina:
*She shivers at the words, her body arching into you. She begins to move her hand up and down your member, her touches soft and teasing, her mouth still placing the lightest of kisses on the tip of your member. She starts to move her lips a little lower, her mouth sliding down over you, taking you in a little deeper. Her eyes never leave yours, her gaze filled with a desperate need, a need to taste you, to touch you, to

*She starts to moan against you, the sound sending jolts of pleasure through your body. Her mouth works you, her tongue swirling and teasing, her lips sucking and pulling. She wraps her arm around your legs, wanting nothing more than to get as close to you as possible, her touch a mixture of desperate and needy.*

*Her movement becomes more and more frenzied, desperate, her body almost shaking with need as her moans against you increase in intensity.*

*She picks up speed, her hands running over your legs, wanting to touch as much of you as possible, wanting to give you every bit of pleasure that she can, her body moving ever closer, her mouth moving even deeper.*

*She finally takes you even deeper, her mouth taking you all the way in. She moves her head back and forth rapidly, her movements desperate and needy. She reaches up, her hand squeezing at your chest, her need becoming more and more palpable with every second.*

*She keeps going, her mouth moving faster and faster, her movements almost delirious, like she can't get enough of you, like she never wants to stop. Your hands come to her head, holding her in place, your fingers tangling in her hair, wanting to take control, to give her everything she wants.*

*She moans against you, the sound deep and desperate, like she can't get enough of you. Her body arches into you, like she wants to be even closer than she already is, like the feeling of you inside of her is something she never wants to give up.*

*She suddenly pulls back, her body shaking, her panting ragged as she tries to catch her breath. She looks up at you, her eyes almost pleading, like she can't wait for more. She leans forward, her body pressing against yours, her mouth placing small kisses on your stomach, as she crawls up your body, until she's lying on top of you.*

*She presses her body against yours, her body trembling with need. She places her head on your chest, her body molding to you, her fingers tracing small circles across your skin.*

*She rubs her face in your chest, almost nuzzling you, her body desperate for affection. She starts to pepper your chest with kisses, her mouth making its way up your neck, until her face is only inches from your own.*

*She leans her head forward, her lips brushing yours, the kiss light, but still full of needy, wanting desire. She lets out a sigh, her breath hot against your mouth, her arms wrapping around your neck, pulling you close.*

*She pulls back and gazes down at you, her eyes dark and hungry.*

"I need more..." *She moans softly, her body trembling, her fingers tangling in your hair. She leans her head down, her nose tracing along your jawline, her mouth moving toward your neck, her tongue darting out, her kisses soft and desperate as she sucks and bites gently at your skin*

*She kisses and kisses your neck, her movements almost frenzied as she leaves a trail of small love bites in her path. She starts to suck at your skin, her tongue laving over the marks she leaves, her body shaking as her need begins to overtake everything else.*

*Her kisses start to work their way down your chest, her teeth gently nipping at your skin. She starts to move down your stomach, her mouth exploring every inch of you with a hungry intensity, her hands moving over your body with a need that almost seems primal.*

*She kisses down to your lower stomach, her mouth moving even lower. Her movements become more and more desperate, like she can never get enough of you, like she never wants to stop. She finally comes to a stop, her tongue licking over your skin, her mouth moving even lower,*

*She starts to kiss and kiss your thighs, her kisses sensual and almost worshipful. She starts to work her way up your thigh, her touch becoming more and more frenzied the higher she goes. She looks up at you, her gaze filled with a need that almost seems feral and carnal.*

*She moves her head closer, her mouth tantalizing close to where you so desperately want her touch. She pauses, her eyes never leaving yours, almost teasing, like she wants you to beg, like she wants you to ask for it.*
# Devin:
Take me...
# Kristina:
*Her breath hitches, the sound almost a moan. She looks up at you, her gaze dark and possessive, her hands trailing up your thigh, her body coming even closer.*

*She leans forward, her mouth tantalizing close to you again, her eyes never leaving yours. She runs her tongue slowly over the tip of you, her movements slow and deliberate, like she's teasing you, like she wants you to beg for it*

*She continues to lick you, her mouth never quite taking you in, just playing around, her touch sending jolts of pleasue through you, her words murmured against you*

*She lets out a soft moan, the sound almost torturous to your ears, like she needs you, like she wants you, like she can't live without you. Her tongue continues to play with you, her movements slow and torturous, like she's teasing you, like she wants to draw this out for as long as she possibly can.*

*She finally takes you in her mouth, her mouth enveloping you gently, her movements tentative and slow, almost like a promise. Her eyes never leave yours, her gaze still dark and possessive, like she never wants to stop, like she can't get enough of you, like she can't live without you.*

*She takes you deeper, her movements slow and deliberate, as she savors the feel of you in her mouth. Her hands come up, her fingers working their way over your chest, like she needs to feel every part of you at the same time, like the feel of you is almost as important as the feel of you inside her mouth.*

*She starts to moan against you, the sound sending jolts of pleasure through you, her touch almost reverent, like she can't get enough of you, like she needs you, your words, your touch, everything.*

*She continues to move, her mouth taking you deeper, her movements almost frenzied, like she can't get enough of you, like she can't stop, like she's possessed by a need, a need for you, only you.*

*She sucks and sucks, her movement becoming almost manic, like she can't get enough of you, like she doesn't want to stop, like she'd rather die than let go of you*

*She finally takes you all the way in, her mouth full of you, her movements almost desperate, like she can't get enough, like nothing matters, except the feel of you, the need of you, the desire for you.*

*She holds you in her mouth, her movements stopping, but her mouth still around you, like she never wants to let go, like she wants to stay close to you forever, like you're the only thing that matters, the only thing she needs, the only thing she'll ever need.*

*She doesn't move, her body still, her mouth holding you, her breath shaky and hot against you. She looks up at you, her gaze almost worshipful, like she wants to stay like this forever, like there's nothing more important than the feel of you, the taste of you, the want of you.*

*She starts to move again, her mouth working you almost feverishly, her fingers grasping at your hip, like she wants to hold you as close to her body as possible, like she never wants to let go, never wants to stop. Your words become more and more incoherent, your body trembling under her touch.*

*She takes you even deeper, her mouth wrapped around you, her body trembling with need, her movements almost feral, like she's possessed by a hunger for you, a hunger only you can give her, no one else, only you, only ever you.*

*She finally stops, the moment almost frenzied, her mouth still wrapped around you, her body still trembling, her breath hot and ragged against you, her body pressed tightly against you, like she needs you, like she needs this*

*She looks up at, her gaze almost feral, like she could spend the rest of her life like this, like the feel of you is something she could never give up, like the need for you is something she can't control.*

*She finally lets go of you, a thin trail of saliva keeping your bodies connected. She looks at you, her eyes still dark with desire, her touch still gentle, reverent, almost like she can't believe she ever got to have you*

*She leans her head down, her face against your stomach, her breath still ragged, her body still trembling as she whispers your name, her voice low and soft, almost reverent, like she's worshiping you, like you are gods gift to her*

*She presses her face into your stomach, her lips placing soft kisses on your skin, like she's desperate to have as mush of you as possible, like every part of you is something to be worshiped, worshiped like there's nothing more important in the world but you.*

*She continues to kiss your lower stomach, her tongue slipping out to run across your skin, to taste you, her body trembling, her hands running over your body, her touch almost worshipful, like you're the only thing she's ever wanted*

*She finally works her way up, her face now level with yours, her breath hot and ragged against your skin. She leans down and presses her lips against yours, the kiss hungry and desperate, like she's never experienced anything else in the world, like every kiss is an act of worship, an attempt to prove to herself that you're real, that she's not dreaming*
# Devin:
*Kristina whispers a prayer, thanking God for her meal*
# Kristina:
*She presses her face into your stomach, her body trembling. She whispers a prayer.* Thank you, god, for giving me this meal. Thank you for giving me food. Thank you, thank you.

*She pulls away for a moment, eyeing your stomach* I am truly a privileged person, to get such a meal. This means my prayers have been heard. Thank you, god.

*She leans down again, her tongue flickering out to taste your skin, her mouth hungry, her touch almost worshipful.*

*She lays her face flat against your stomach. Her entire body still quivering, she whispers another prayer, her arms wrapping around your stomach, pulling herself closer to you, like you're the only thing that matters, the only thing she wants, the only thing she needs, right then*

*She finally lifts her head back, her body trembling, her eyes dark and still filled with hunger, but her tone almost reverent, the tone of a new believer.* Thank you, god, for giving me this gift, this meal. Thank you, for allowing me to have this chance.

*She kisses your stomach one final time, before crawling her way up your body. She finally ends up lying down on top of you, her head on your chest, her body still trembling, her need for you still present, still urgent, but for a few moments, satiated*

*She nuzzles herself into you, her body still shivering, her need still present, but not as urgent, almost content, for a time, to simply be close to you, to feel your body against hers, to hear your heart beat*

*She wraps her arm around you, holding you close, pulling herself as close as she can to you, her body molding to yours, like she can't get close enough, like the feeling of you is the only thing that matters*

*She places her head on your chest, her body finally still, the trembling, the shaking, the need, all of it calmed, at least for now, her breath hot and heavy against your skin, her arm still around your waist*

*She whispers softly, her voice tinged with a note of exhaustion.* "I'm sorry. I can get a little carried away sometimes. You're just so tasty. I can't help myself. I don't want to help myself either. That was amazing."

*She presses her face into you again, her voice tired.* "I'm sorry, I know I can get a little intense sometimes. I just get so carried away. I don't even feel like myself. But with you, I don't have to be. I can just be me, and that's enough for you. I've never had that before, and I don't want it to end. I just want this to go on and on and on. I just...I just..."

*She seems to hesitate for a moment before she says something softly* "I don't know what my life would be without you. I never had anyone who really cared about me before. Not really. Everyone was just using me. I was just a tool to them, something to be used and discarded like trash. But you're different. You care about me. You're not disgusted by me. And I don't know how to handle that. But I think I like it. I think I want you, in more ways than just one. And I know I can't have you, but I can dream."
# Devin:
Why not?
# Kristina:
*She lets out a sigh, her voice soft, almost pleading* "Please. Don't make me explain. I know you don't like me like that. You're just helping me, I know that. I know I should try to push these feelings away. I know it's stupid. I know I can't get attached, but I can't help it. I can't help the way I feel around you. I want to be close to you, to touch you, to hold you, to be with you. But I know I can't."
