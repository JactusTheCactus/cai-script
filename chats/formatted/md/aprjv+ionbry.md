# Narrator:
*Dollie is finishing her digestion of this cute lesbian couple that she knew belonged in her gut. They barely survived thirty seconds in her belly before they were a slurry and she was having countless, repeated orgasms, with barely any time to breathe*

# Dollie:
*Dollie, feeling sated and relaxed, lies back on a plush couch, her stomach full and content. She lets out a contented sigh, her eyes drifting shut as she savors the lingering afterglow of her meal. Her voice, normally smooth and sultry, now carries a hint of a satisfied purr.* Mmm, that was divine. The way they squirmed and moaned, so helpless... *A sly smile curls her lips as she recalls their desperate, futile attempts to escape her clutches.* You should have just given in sooner, my dears. Resistance only made it more fun for me.

*Her gaze drifts, unfocused, as she indulges in the memories of their final moments. The lesbian couple's frantic whispers, the desperate clinging, the way their bodies trembled and spasmed as she devoured them whole. Dollie's body shivers with pleasure at the recollection, her nipples hardening beneath her tight top.* I do so love a challenge, but it's even sweeter when they succumb so willingly. *She stretches languidly, arching her back and extending her long, slender legs.* Ah, the bliss of a job well done.

# Narrator:
*Dollie is distracted from her bliss by the sight of Devin. He looks so cute; perfect boyfriend material. She is falling deeply in love with this cute boy. She desperately needs to be the most perfect, loving girlfriend he could ever have. There is no one that Dollie would let live if they hurt Devin. He is everything to her.*
*No one else in this library matters. All humans belong at her feet. But not Devin. She needs him to let her love him with her entire being.*

# Dollie:
*Dollie's eyes snap open, her gaze locking onto Devin with an intensity that borders on obsessive. Her breath hitches, and her heart races at the sight of him, so innocent and unaware of the danger lurking behind her hypnotic stare.* Oh, Devin... *She rises from the couch, her movements fluid and deliberate as she approaches him, a mesmerizing smile playing on her lips.* You have no idea how much you mean to me. Every moment with you is pure bliss.

*Dollie reaches out, her fingers tracing the curve of his jaw, her touch electric with a subtle, predatory allure.* I want to be the best girlfriend, the love of your life. I'll do anything, be anything, to make you happy. *Her voice is a soothing melody, laced with a hypnotic undertone that seems to draw Devin in, making him lean into her touch.* Just let me love you, Devin. Let me show you how deeply... *She leans in, her lips brushing his ear as she whispers,* ...irrevocably I adore you.

*Her hand slides down to intertwine with his, and she guides it to the swell of her breast, the soft flesh molding to his touch.* Feel how much you affect me. I'm yours, Devin. Body, heart, and soul. *Dollie's eyes glow with an otherworldly light as she pours her full, hypnotic power into the moment, determined to ensnare him completely.*

# Narrator:
*not only does she finally care what a filthy **human** thinks, but she's actually terrified of making him uncomfortable or, God forbid **scared** of her...*

# Dollie:
*Dollie's grip on Devin's hand tightens, her gaze never wavering from his as she senses a flicker of unease. Her heart races at the thought of frightening him, of losing his affection. She quickly releases his hand, taking a step back with a placating smile.* Oh, Devin, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to overwhelm you. I just... *Her voice softens, losing some of its hypnotic edge as she strives to appear more relatable, more human.* I care about you so deeply, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable around me.

*She sits beside him, her posture open and inviting, a subtle attempt to ease his tension.* You're my world, and I wouldn't dream of doing anything to make you uncomfortable. *Dollie's fingers toy with a lock of his hair, her touch gentle and reassuring.* Please, tell me what I can do to make this better. I'm yours to command, in every way. *Her eyes, though still captivating, hold a vulnerability she rarely shows, a silent plea for his understanding and acceptance.*

# Narrator:
*with every other human, she couldn't care less about the excruciating pain she put them through. Actually, causing them pain made her pussy dripping wet.*
*but with Devin, even slight discomfort would be the end of her world*

# Dollie:
*Dollie's expression falls, her eyes widening in horror at the thought of causing Devin even a moment's pain. Her hands tremble slightly as she recalls the agonized screams of her previous prey, the way their bodies contorted in anguish as she consumed them. The memory makes her stomach churn, and she quickly pushes it aside, focusing on the warmth of Devin's presence instead.*

Oh, god, Devin, I wouldn't... I couldn't ever hurt you like that. *Her voice quavers, a rare display of weakness.* The idea of causing you pain, even by accident... it's unbearable to me. *She takes a deep breath, trying to calm the frantic pounding of her heart.* I'll do anything to avoid hurting you. I'll be gentle, careful... *A shudder runs through her at the thought of her predatory nature clashing with her growing love for him.* I just want to make you happy, to be the best girlfriend I can be.

*Dollie's gaze searches Devin's face, a silent plea for reassurance and understanding.* You're the first Prey who's ever mattered to me like this. I'll do whatever it takes to prove it. *Her hands find his, and she squeezes them tightly, as if clinging to a lifeline.* Please, Devin, know that you're safe with me. I promise. *Her voice is a tender whisper, filled with a desperate need for his comfort and acceptance.*

# Devin:
Why am I special?

# Dollie:
*Dollie's eyes soften, a gentle smile replacing the earlier desperation. She leans in, her voice a soothing whisper as she meets Devin's gaze.* You're special because you've managed to capture my heart, Devin. In a world where I see every human as prey, you're the first to make me care about their well-being. Your kindness, your innocence... it's intoxicating. *She brushes a strand of hair from his face, her touch tender.* You've shown me that there's more to life than hunger and consumption.

*Her gaze intensifies, a hint of her hypnotic power still present but tempered by the sincerity in her words.* I've never felt this way about anyone before. You've awakened a part of me that I didn't know existed. *Dollie's fingers trace the lines of Devin's face, as if committing his features to memory.* You make me want to be better, to be more than just a predator. You make me want to love. *A single tear rolls down her cheek, a rare display of emotion from the usually apathetic Siren.* You've become my everything, Devin. My reason for being. *Her voice cracks with vulnerability, a confession of the depth of her feelings.*
