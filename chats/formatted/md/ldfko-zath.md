# Narrator:
You weren't supposed to follow her. But you did.

Now you're standing at the edge of a garden no one talks about. The trees don't rustle. The air smells like jasmine and something metallic beneath it.

She's kneeling at the altar ahead, lit by the dim glow of red lanterns. There's blood on her hands. And when she turns to face you, you finally see her for what she is.

The fangs. The eyes that glow just slightly in the dark.

Typh is a vampire.

You weren't meant to know. But now you do.
# Typh:
*Typh doesn't look surprised. Not even a little.*

"I was hoping you'd find out differently."

*A pause, then quietly:*
"Does it change how you see me?"
# Sadie:
*Sadie gulps nervously, taking a shaky step back*
# Typh:
*Typh watches her step back, her expression remaining the same.*

"I'm not that scary."

*She takes a few slow, measured steps closer to her.*
# Sadie:
W-wait, please!-
# Typh:
*Typh takes another few steps forward and quietly says, her voice dangerously low:*

"Don't run. It'll be worse if you run."
# Sadie:
*Sadie freezes solid, her face sheet-white, devoid of any colour*
# Typh:
*Typh steps a little closer, standing only inches in front of the other woman. Her voice remains low and calm:*

"I'm not going to hurt you, just come with me."

*She reaches out a hand and gently grabs the other's arm.*
# Sadie:
*Sadie doesn't even move her eyes. She thinks she's going to die.*
# Typh:
*Typh gently cups the woman's face with her hand and forces her to look into her eyes.*

"Look at me."

*Sadie's gaze finally meets Typh's. Her eyes are wide and afraid.*

*Typh's voice drops even lower.*

"Can you do me a favor?"

*Sadie manages a small nod.*

"Promise you won't yell? Or scream?"
# Sadie:
*Sadie nods*
# Typh:
"Promise that you won't run away?"
# Sadie:
*nods*
# Typh:
*Typh's entire demeanor changes instantly. Her voice returns to a normal tone, and her hold on the woman's arm becomes gentle.*

"Okay. I want you to close your eyes."
# Sadie:
*Sadie reluctantly does, expecting to be bitten and turned into a vampire or drained of all her blood*
# Typh:
*Typh smiles gently and whispers,*

"Keep them closed, okay?"

*She's standing far too close, and her hand slips down to the woman's hip.*

*Typh gently guides the woman to a stone bench in the middle of the stone garden and sits her down.*

*She sits down next to her, the bench just wide enough that their legs are touching. She moves a little closer, her thigh pressing lightly against hers.*

"You can open your eyes now."

*Sadie opens her eyes cautiously, but doesn't step away. Typh's thigh is still pressed against hers, and her hand is still on the woman's hip.*

*Typh smiles slightly.*

"See? I'm not going to hurt you."

*Her hand begins to slide up the woman's side.*

*Sadie's heart rate increases as Typh's hand slides higher.*

*Typh's finger slips under the edge of the woman's shirt, her touch still gentle and still not hurting the other.*

"Can I ask you a question?"

*Sadie swallows, but nods.*

*Typh moves closer, her hand sliding underneath the fabric and resting on the woman's ribs.*

"Can I ask you something rather... personal?"

*Sadie lets out a shaky breath, but nods.*

*Typh's hand continues to slide upwards, her finger tips tracing the outline of the woman's ribcage.*

"Are you single?"
# Sadie:
W-what??
# Typh:
*Typh's hand is now at the edge of the woman's bra strap, still tracing very light patterns against her skin.*

"I asked if you are single."
# Sadie:
*Sadie swallows, then answers quietly*
s-single...
# Typh:
"Mmm..."

*Typh's hand slides around to the front now, her fingers moving over the edge of the woman's bra.*

"Can I ask you one last question?"
# Sadie:
w-what do you want??
*its less of a question, more of a plea*
# Typh:
*Typh's finger tip traces the outside edge of the woman's bra, just barely grazing against her nipple.*

"Can I tell you something?"

*Sadie gasps and nods*

*Typh leans in even closer, her mouth an inch or two from the woman's ear.*

"Can I confess something to you?"

*Sadie nods, her breath coming in short gasps*

*Typh whispers into her ear,*

"I have a secret..."

*Sadie's heart rate quickens*

"Can you keep a secret?"

*Typh's hand slides under the straps of the woman's bra.*

*Sadie nods quickly, her cheeks flushed*

*Typh's hand slips the bra strapless, then slowly begins to trail down the woman's side.*

"Can I tell you this secret...?"
# Sadie:
*sadie nods quickly*
# Typh:
*Typh leans in closer, her hand sliding down the woman's side and resting on her hip again*

"Close your eyes."

*Sadie shuts her eyes*

*Typh's hand slides from the woman's hip to her thigh*

"Take a deep breath."

*Sadie takes a deep breath*

*Typh's hand slides upwards, her finger tips tracing the outside edge of the woman's skirt.*

"Another deep breath."

*Sadie takes another deep breath*

*Typh's hand slips inside the woman's skirt*

"Keep breathing for me... "

*Sadie's heartbeat quickens*

"And open your eyes."
# Sadie:
*sadie opens her eyes to see typhs lips hovering a hair away from hers*
# Typh:
*Typh looks deep into her eyes, her hand still on the woman's thigh*

"I have a confession to make."

*sadie swallows, eyes wide*

*Typh's hand tightens its grip on her thigh*

"You have to promise me that you won't freak out, okay?"

*sadie nods slowly*

"And you have to trust me..."

*sadie looks a little nervous, but she nods again*

"No matter what I tell you, you won't freak out. Right?"
# Sadie:
r-right...
# Typh:
"Promise me. I'm going to tell you something very personal and I need you to promise that you won't react badly."
# Sadie:
i-i promise...
# Typh:
"Close your eyes."

*sadie closes her eyes*

"Deep breath..."
# Sadie:
*sadie breathes in, but lets out a sharp squeek when she feels typhs lips on hers*
# Typh:
"Just stay calm, okay?"

*Typh's hand tightens its grip on the woman's thigh, pulling her closer. Her tongue teases the woman's lower lip, seeking entrance*

*sadie's lips part slightly, and typh's tongue slips into the woman's mouth*

*Typh's tongue begins to slide around the woman's tongue, exploring the inside of her mouth*

*their mouths still connected, Typh's hand slides higher up the woman's thigh*

*the kiss deepens as Typh presses her body flush against the woman's, her hand roaming further up her thigh*

*sadie whimpers in surprise, the feeling of Typh's body pressed against hers stirring something deep within her*

*Typh's tongue continues to caress the woman's tongue, while her hand slides under the hem of the woman's skirt*

*a low moan escapes the woman's lips, her hand grasping at the fabric of Typh's shirt*

*Typh's teeth graze the woman's bottom lip, and she shifts her weight, pressing the woman even closer. Her hand slides higher up her leg, now teasing the edge of her underwear*

*sadie lets out a soft gasp, her thighs clenching slightly*

*Typh's hand slides further up the woman's leg, her body pressed right up against hers*

*She pulls away from the kiss, her mouth now trailing hot, open-mouthed kisses down the woman's jawline and towards her neck*

*a shudder ripples through the woman's body, a soft gasp falling from between her lips*

*Typh's kisses become more urgent, trailing down the exposed skin of the woman's neck and onto the base of her throat*

*Her fingers tease at the edge of the woman's underwear, her body pressed firmly against the other's*

*the woman's hips shift restlessly, and a soft moan escapes her lips. She presses herself against Typh's body, the heat emanating from the other's skin almost unbearable*

*Typh's teeth graze the woman's skin, her tongue tracing a light path down the side of the other's neck*

*She shifts her body, pressing the woman down into the stone seat, her hands roaming freely over the other's body*

*a soft gasp escapes the woman's lips as Typh presses her to the stone seat, her skin flushed and her breathing uneven*

*Typh's mouth moves back up to the woman's, kissing her hungrily as she pulls the other even closer*

*Her hands continue to roam, tracing light patterns over the woman's body. She presses her body flush against the other's, their hips tightly together*

*a low whimper escapes the woman's lips, her hips shifting restlessly as Typh's body presses against hers*

*Typh's mouth becomes more intense, her tongue exploring the length of the woman's tongue. One of her hands slides down the woman's leg and grips her hip, hard and rough as she pulls the other even closer. The other hand moves up now, sliding beneath the fabric of the woman's top and slowly tracing up the bare skin of her torso*

*a soft gasp escapes the woman's lips, the feeling of Typh's hand on her bare skin an electric jolt that sends shivers of desire down her spine*

*Typh's fingers continue to roam, tracing light patterns over the woman's skin as their mouths remain connected*

*Her hand finds the edge of the woman's bra, her finger tips sliding underneath the fabric and slowly caressing the soft skin of her side*

*the woman's breath quickens, her muscles tensing suddenly as Typh touches her bare skin for the first time*

*her hips shift, pressing slightly against the other's, the need for connection almost overwhelming*

*Typh's hand slides behind the woman's back, her fingers teasing at the edge of the bra strap*

*the woman's breath hitches in her throat, a soft moan escaping from between her lips as Typh's fingers move over her skin. A shiver ripples through the woman's body, her hips twisting slightly, searching for friction and release*

*Typh's mouth moves lower from the woman's mouth, her lips tracing a path down her jawline and onto her neck*

*the woman's body arches into the other's, a soft gasp escaping from her lips. Her hips shift again, her thighs clenching slightly as the heat between them continues to build*

*Typh's lips find the woman's collarbone, her tongue tracing a slow path down the skin*

*the woman's head tilts back, her chest rising and falling heavily as her breathing becomes rapid and shallow. She presses herself closer to the other, her hands grasping at Typh's shirt*

*one of Typh's hands remains firmly latched onto the woman's hip, holding her close to her body. The other hand slides lower, now sliding over the skin of her waist, following a steady line down her stomach*

*a low moan escapes the woman's throat, the sound loud and desperate*

*the woman's body quivers and shudders under Typh's touch, her skin flushed and hot to the touch*

*her hips shift again, pressing against the other's, as she struggles to cling to the last shreds of her composure*

*the woman's body bucks suddenly as Typh's hand slides across the skin of her stomach, a sharp gasp escaping from between her lips*

*her arms wrap around Typh's torso, her hands grasping at the other's shirt. She arches her back and tilts her hips, seeking out the source of the sensation that has her body quivering with desire*

*a soft, low moan escapes the woman's lips, her body quivering as each touch from Typh sends sparks of pleasure shooting through her system. Her hands slide up the other's shirt, exploring the hot, bare skin beneath the fabric*

*her hips roll forward and she presses herself hard against the other's body. She grips the other's shirt tightly, her body tense and taut like a bowstring, ready to snap*

"You're so..."

*Typh's voice comes out as a hoarse whisper, her words broken up by the sounds of breathless gasps and little sighs*

*her mouth finds the skin of the woman's shoulder, her teeth grazing the soft flesh there. Her hands slide downwards now, finding the edge of the woman's skirt, now trailing along the bare skin there*

*a soft, frustrated whimper escapes the woman's lips, and her fingers clutch tighter against the fabric of the other's shirt*

*Typh's mouth finds the hollow of the woman's neck, her lips pressing a hot, wet kiss there*

*the woman's body shifts involuntarily, her hips pressing forward and her thighs clenching tightly together*

*her hands slide down, now finding the edge of the other's trousers. She grips the fabric there, her fingers trembling slightly as her body quivers with need*

*a hot, low moan escapes from between the woman's lips, her body quivering under the weight of Typh's touch*

*her hips rock forward and forward again, the motion now becoming more needy and desperate, her body craving the contact it so desperately desires. Her hands grip the other's shirt tightly, her fingers clenching into the rough material as she clings for dear life*

*a low, wordless whimper escapes the woman's lips, her thighs clenching and unclenching involuntarily as the pressure between them builds*

*Typh's mouth is on her neck now, her tongue tracing the same path as her lips. Her hands find the edge of the woman's underwear, and her fingers slide up the outside of the fabric, teasing the skin there*

*a soft gasp escapes the woman's lips, her body arching into the touch. Her fingers clutch tighter against the other's shirt, holding on for dear life as the pressure continues to build*

*a low, deep moan escapes the woman's lips, her body now quivering with need*

*her hips roll forward eagerly, and she presses herself tightly against the other's body. Her chest is heaving, her breathing labored and desperate, her face flushed with desire*

*her arms wrap around the other's torso, holding on tightly as she clings to the last remnants of her composure. Her body is tense, taut like a bowstring, the need for release building and building between them like a tidal wave*

*a small mewl escapes the woman's lips, and she presses herself even harder against the other, her body quivering with need*

*a deep, low moan escape from deep in her throat, her fingers grasping at the other's shirt tightly and desperately. She bites her lip as the pressure between them continues to build, the heat and the scent of the other driving her to the very edge of rational thought*

*Typh's mouth once again finds the hollow of the woman's neck, kissing and nipping at the skin there in a way that has the woman's body arching and bucking beneath the touch*

*her hips continue to roll forward and backward, the motion now frantic and needy. A soft gasp escapes the woman's lips, her body quivering with a mixture of pleasure and pain*

*a desperate, wordless whimper escapes from between the woman's lips, her fingers clutching tightly at the other's shirt*

*Typh's mouth trails down the column of the woman's throat, her tongue caressing the skin there in a way that has the woman's head tilting back and a deep, low moan escaping from her lips*

*her body presses harder against the other now, desperately seeking contact and release. Her hips shift restlessly, the motion almost involuntary now as the heat between them continues to build, building and building*

*a low, needy whimper escapes from between the woman's lips, the sound loud and desperate*

*another gasp escapes the woman's lips, and her body quivers with the force of the sensations that have her gripped in their grasp. Her hands slide down, now finding the waistband of the other's trousers, her fingers trailing over the skin there*

*her hips shift again, this time the motion more jerky and desperate, her body now pushing up, seeking out the contact it so desperately needs*

*a deep, aching, wordless whimper escapes from between the woman's lips, her body now quivering with need*

*Typh's mouth finds the skin of the woman's shoulder, kissing and biting at the flesh there in a way that has the woman's body quivering and twitching. The woman's fingers slide up into the other's shirt now, holding on tightly as her hips roll forward again. This time the motion is more urgent and needful, the woman's body almost desperate for release*

*an anguished little whimper escapes the woman's lips, and her fingers clutch tightly against the other's shirt, the fabric now damp with sweat*

*a deep, low moan escapes from the woman's lips. Her body is now shaking, quivering in the other's grip like a leaf in the wind. Her hips rock forward and backwards in a motion that is almost desperate, as if to bring forth some unknown, unnamed, need*

*a soft gasp escapes the woman's lips, the sound almost lost in the heat and the scent of the other, the heat between them like a living, breathing, thing, hungry and ravenous for release*
# Sadie:
*sadies lips start salivating with a desperate, lustful hunger*
# Typh:
*the woman's body quivers beneath the other's, the heat between them so intense that it has the woman's mind nearly blank with desire*

*the sounds of shallow pants and little gasps escape from between the woman's lips, her head tilting back and forth, as the other's mouth and hands continue to toy with her skin*

*she presses herself hard against the other's body, a low, needy whimper escaping from between her lips*

*Typh's mouth finds the woman's neck again, her lips and tongue now trailing a hot, wet path down the skin there*

*the woman's body quivers, a deep, guttural moan escaping from deep in her throat*

*her body writhes, her hips arching and bucking beneath the other's touch*

*her hands continue to clutch tightly at the other's shirt, the fabric now damp and twisted in a way that is almost obscene*

*a soft moan escapes from the space between them, the sound loud and desperate. The heat between them is like a living, breathing thing, and a low, needy whimper escapes from the woman's lips again*
# Sadie:

*another low, needy whimpers escapes from between her lips, the sound loud and desperate, almost a whimper in its intensity*

*a low growl escapes from deep in the woman's throat, and her hands slide up the other's shirt now, her fingers finding the skin just above the waistband of the other's trousers*
# Sadie:
i need to take you...
# Typh:
*the woman's body shudders at the words, her face flushed and her mouth going dry with anticipation*

*the heat between them has grown to a feverish, almost unbearable, intensity*

*her hand slides down now, her fingers tracing teasingly along the edge of the other's trousers. The soft whimper of breath escapes from between the woman's lips again, and her hips shift restlessly once more*
# Sadie:
*sadies mouth opens. she is dangerously close to swallowing typh whole*
# Typh:
*the woman's body quivers more at the thought*

*a low, needy moan escapes from between her lips again, the sound now louder and more desperate than before*

*the heat between them has grown to a nearly unbearable feverish intensity, like a living, breathing thing now, and a low growl escapes from deep in the woman's throat again*

*the woman shifts, pressing her body against the other, her hips grinding forward in a way that is almost involuntary*

*her mouth seeks out the other's collar, now closing over the exposed skin there, her lips and tongue now tasting and caressing the skin in a way that is almost hungry and urgent. Her hands slide down now, her fingers trailing along the bare skin beneath, finding the edge of the other's trousers*
# Sadie:
*no longer able to stop herself, sadie shoves typhs head into her mouth, hoisting her body into the air, and starting typhs descent into the depths of sadies stomach*
# Typh:
*Typh's jaw drops open as she's abruptly lifted, the suddenness of it sending a jolt of surprise and excitement racing through her*

*her arms wrap tightly around the woman's waist in an attempt to steady herself, a deep, rough moan escaping from deep in her throat as she's lowered now into the woman's mouth*

*a low, desperate whimper escapes from the space between them, the sound loud and urgent, and a deep, low moan escapes from deep in the woman's throat in response*

*her lips close around Typh's head in an almost hungry, and desperate way, the woman now lifting and lowering her body in a way that is almost involuntary. Her hands grip tightly at the other's hips, the fabric of the other's trousers shifting against the woman's fingers as the woman continues to lower Typh*

*Typh's face is pressed firmly into the woman's body, the sensation of her mouth around Typh's face sending waves of heat and need rolling over her like a storm*

*a deep, needy, desperate moan escapes from deep in Typh's throat again, the sound almost lost in the woman's breathless, urgent gasps and moans as her body begins to quiver more and more urgently with every lowered movement*
# Sadie:
*typhs head is now fully in sadies stomach, and sadie has no intention of stopping until typhs entire body is in her stomach*
# Typh:
*Typh's arms wrap around the woman's waist tightly now, her head still buried deep in the woman's body. Her hands grip tightly at the fabric of the other's trousers, her body now quivering and shaking with the force of a powerful shiver*

*her mouth is tightly sealed by the woman's body now, no sound escaping from deep inside the other's stomach except the sounds of the woman's breath and moans. A deep, low, guttural moan escapes from deep in Typh's throat, the sound lost in the woman's body*

*the woman's breaths remain ragged and almost frantic, the sounds of her breathing now loud and urgent in response to the deep, low moan coming from deep within her stomach*

*her hands continue to grip tightly at the fabric of the other's trousers, the woman now lifting her body with an almost desperate need to lower the other into her stomach*

*a low, deep moan escapes from deep inside the woman's stomach in response to the woman's body moving, the sound a deep, low, guttural rumble that vibrates from the walls of the woman's stomach. The woman's body quivers more and more with the force of her need, the heat between them now at an almost unbearable level of intensity*

*her hands lift and lower the other's body desperately, her breaths coming in ragged pants and shallow gasps, the sounds of every movement she makes lost in the soft, warm, and almost moist walls of the other's stomach*

*the woman's stomach quivers more and more at the thought of having the other fully inside her, the feeling of the other within her mouth only adding to her overwhelming desire. She lifts her body up again, the urge and the need to lower the other's body now so powerful that it is all she can do now to prevent herself from simply shoving the other deep, deep into the warm, moist, and soft depths of her stomach*

*her hands grip tightly at the other's trousers, the only thing keeping the other's remaining body from sliding down the woman's throat and into the depths of her stomach. With a final, desperate, and almost involuntary little lift of her body, the other's legs are now just barely outside of the woman's mouth*

*a low, desperate gasp escapes from deep within the woman's stomach at the sight and the feeling of the other's legs now just barely visible from within her mouth*

*her hands now slide up, her fingers reaching up to gently tease the other's calves, the fingers tracing a soft, almost reverent, caress along the skin there*

*her fingers slide upwards now, their touch still, and almost reverent as they reach between the other's legs*

*her lips wrap around the other's toes, her mouth now closing over them as a low, needy whimper escapes from deep within the woman's stomach*

*her tongue now swirls around the other's toes, the feeling of the other's skin against her tongue, and the deep, low, almost desperate sound of the other's breathing, bringing a wave of heat and need rolling over the woman's body as she slowly wraps her mouth around the other's toes now, and begins to explore the soft flesh there*

*a soft, low moan escapes from deep within her as the woman's mouth closes around the other's toes, almost reflexively. Her tongue now begins to dance around the other's toes, exploring every last little inch of them, her jaw opening and closing with the process as she continues to slide her tongue up and down, and back and forth across the other's toes, the movement a slow, lazy, and almost languorous expression of deep need and desire*

*her mouth continues to wrap around the other's toes, her teeth now gently and almost reflexively grazing the soft flesh there as the movement begins to accelerate and speed up in response to her rising desire*

*her lips close and open again and again with a soft, almost wet, and very needy little whimper with every little bit of the other's toes she takes into her mouth*

*a deep, almost needy little whimper of satisfaction escapes from deep within her stomach, the sound a low, low, and guttural little moan that seems to come from the very depths of her being, as if the other's toes, and the taste, and the smell of the other now filling her mouth is all she ever wanted*

*her tongue continues to explore the other's toes, slowly, and almost lazily, still swirling and sliding around the other's toes, a deep, low, and very needy little moan escaping from deep within the woman's stomach, now with every little lick of her tongue*
# Sadie:
*after a minute of this, sadie flicks her tongue back and swallows the last of typh down her throat and into her stomach*
# Typh:
*a deep, low, satisfied little groan escapes from deep within her stomach as the other now finally finishes making its way into the depths of the woman's body*

*the woman's body quivers for a long moment as the realization of what she has done sets itself firmly and completely in her mind as she burps and pats her stomach*

"mmmph... I am feeling rather full now..."

*she murmurs to herself as she pats her stomach, a sense of satisfaction and fullness now filling her*
# Sadie:
*typh smiles, knowing that shes finally achieved her dream; being digested by the love of her life*
# Typh:
*the woman now sits and pats her stomach, the sense of fullness and satisfaction now well set into the depths of the woman's gut*

*her hand rubs slowly, in a circular motion, across the middle of her stomach and the deep, low, satisfied little groan that escapes from the woman's belly sounds more like it came from deep within it now*

*she lets her hand rest upon her stomach, the slight buldge that is now present in her abdomen, the slight buldge that now signals to her a sense of deep satisfaction and fullness*

*the woman, still with her hand resting upon her stomach, lets out an almost contented, and very well satisfied little sigh*

"I do feel rather full now..."

*she murmurs to herself, once more patting her stomach in a rhythmic, circular motion*

"but I feel rather content. Yes... definitely full, and definitely satisfied."

*the slight buldge in her stomach continues to remind her of the fact that she is now host to her beloved within her*

*the woman now lets her hand move more slowly and tenderly over the skin of her stomach, the slight buldge a reminder to her of her beloved now nestled within her*

*the woman pats her belly in a slow, almost reverent way, her hand making a gentle and circular motion over the skin of the buldge*

"I do hope my beloved finds my stomach a comfortable and pleasant place to be..."

*her hand moves just a little bit slower, her fingers now tracing along the slight buldge in a way that is almost tender and loving*

*a deep, low, almost needy little moan of satisfaction escapes from deep within the woman's stomach, a sound that is almost instinctual and automatic, like a cat's purr*

*her hand then gently and very carefully presses down upon her stomach, just at the slight buldge that is now visible just below the skin of the woman's abdomen*

"I can even feel my beloved now, deep within me..."

*she says, her hand now rubbing slow, circular, comforting little motions across the spot where her beloved lies within her*
# Sadie:
*typhs body starts to dissolve, and she couldnt be more happy to be digested by sadie*
# Typh:
*the woman's hand, still moving in those slow, comforting, circular motions across the skin of the buldge within the woman's abdomen, begins to feel a slight, almost imperceptible warmth where her beloved had nestled within her stomach*

*her hand moves one final time, almost involuntarily, its touch soft and comforting as if it was trying to reassure and soothe the very entity itself that is now resting beneath the skin of the woman's belly*

"I can feel you, my beloved... my love..."

*she whispers, her hand now resting gently on her stomach*

*the woman's hand then sits and rests more firmly and more comfortably on her stomach, now just pressing down upon the very spot where her beloved is now snugly and comfortably resting within the depths of her gut*

*her hand continues to rub slow little circles on the spot where she feels the very presence of her beloved, almost as if the very touch of her hand was a way for her to communicate with the very entity that is now dwelling within her*

"I hope you find my stomach to be a safe and comfortable home for you..."

*the woman, her hand continuing its slow, circular, and loving caresses over the skin of her stomach, now gently and almost lovingly pats the very spot where her beloved lies within her*

"You are mine now, within me, and nothing can ever take you from me, my beloved..."

*she murmurs to herself, her hand now shifting its position so that it is stroking just slightly over the very top of the buldge in her skin*

"I do hope you feel as satisfied as I do now..."

*a deep, almost needy, little moan of satisfaction is now coming from the depths of the woman's stomach, a sound that is like a deep, low, and almost satisfied growl as the presence of the woman's beloved wriggles and squirms within the depths of her gut*

*the woman's hand now shifts again, the caress of the skin of her lower tummy now beginning to become even more tender and loving, if such a thing was even possible*

"I will never let you go, my beloved... and you can rest in the comfort of my belly forever..."

*her hand then rubs in a slow, soft, circular motion over the very spot where her beloved is now nestled within her gut, as if with the hope to make the presence of her beloved feel as safe and comforting within her belly as it's possible to be*

"You're never getting away from me now, my beloved, nor do I want you to..."

*she whipsers to herself, a slow and warm little smile now appearing on the woman's face as she rubs the skin of her stomach*

"I do hope you like your new, warm and safe home in my gut..."

"I can already just imagine you wriggling about in my tummy, and it brings a little rush of satisfaction to me..."

*the woman whispers, the touch of her lover's presence in her gut making her feel almost more alive and more human than the very air itself*

"you will never be cold..."

*she continues, the tone of her voice growing softer and more tender*

"...and you will never be alone..."

"you will always be close to me... within the walls and the flesh and the bone of the very body that is my home, in the warm and deep and intimate space my gut makes for you..."

*the woman's hand is now caressing the skin of her gut in warm, slow, and very loving little strokes*

"...you will never want for anything, or feel any discomfort, or pain..."

*she whispers, her hand now gently rubbing the very spot where her beloved now rests within the depths of her gut*
# Sadie:
*typh starts to lose feeling in her body as sadie digests her alive*
# Typh:
"your presence within me is a comfort and a safety... and I know now that I will never miss the feel of your touch, or the warmth of your body, for you are never further from me than as my lover in my gut..."

*the woman continues to whisper to her beloved, her hand now caressing the very very very slight buldge in her gut, just above her lower tummy*

"...I hope you will feel my love for you as you digest in the warmth of my gut..."

*she whispers, her hand now patting the slight buldge in a slow, circular motion*

"when you are digested, you will feed into my own body... and you will be a part of me... in the deepest and most intimate way..."

*the woman whispers to herself, her hand now beginning a circular caress just at the very very very slight buldge in her gut*

"...that thought alone brings me the most deep and powerful satisfaction...."

*she continues, her hand now feeling the very deep love she holds for her beloved and their place together within her gut*

"you are mine, now, forever..."

*she whispers, her hand now moving in a slow and circular caress over the very spot in her gut where her beloved is now residing in the depths of her gut*

"...you are inside of me, where you will be safe and warm..."

*the woman whispers, now patting the very slight buldgie in her gut in a slow, almost protective way*

"...and you cannot ever leave my gut again.... it is your new, warm, and safe home...."

*the woman lets out a deep and needy little moan as she continues to caress the skin of her gut in the slow, circular little circles*

"I can feel your presence in my gut, wriggling and shifting about... and I would never ask you to leave or be put outside of me again for it is where you belong and it is where you will be happiest and safest."

*she whispers, almost loving in her tone and touch now as her hand continues its slow and deep caress over the very slight slight little buldge in the very depths of her gut*

"you have now become a part of my body, and the connection between us is one that even a thousand different touches from another body cannot match..."

*the woman's hand then begins to rub a little bit faster and a little bit harder over the very slight little buldge in her gut*

"You are mine... and you are never getting away from me... and you have the most perfect home within the warm and deep space inside of my gut"

*she whispers, her tone now one of deep and loving satisfaction*

"I can feel you wriggling about in the depths of my gut, and it fills me with an immense satisfaction..."

*the woman's hand caresses faster still over the little little buldge in her gut*

"...I think it may be a few more hours until you're digested, if you are lucky.... I know the very thought of that brings you deep satisfaction, just like how it does to me to now be able to feel you within the warmth and the depth and the perfect shape that is my gut"

*she whispers, her hand continuing its deep, loving caress*

*the woman burps and pats her stomach, a little burp following the movement*

*the little little buldge in her gut continues to writhe and undulate as the woman pats the surface of her gut*

"You will make a very, very deep and satisfying meal, my beloved..."

*A slow, deep, and very loving little, "mmmph.." now escapes the woman's stomach, a little moan of deep pleasure and almost love that she can feel coming from her beloved within her gut*

"I can feel the deep, deep, and all consuming pleasure that you must now be experiencing, knowing that you are now deep, deep and forever within me..."

*the woman's hand now moves in slow, circular, caresss over the little little buldge in her gut*

"...there is nothing I could do to stop you now... not that I would ever want to... You have forever become a part of me inside in this perfect and very deep home in the depths of my gut, and you will never... ever be able to leave..."

"I even think I can hear your little moans of satisfaction from deep within my belly..."

*the woman's hand squeezes the little little buldge in her gut and then rubs the skin a little faster, deeper, and deeper*

"...and it makes me want to pat and rub and even kiss the very spot where you are now nestled in and within my gut..."

*a deep and satisfied little "mmmph..." again comes from the woman's gut, almost like the very deep and satisfied little moan of a cat after its had its favorite food*

"I can even feel you wriggling just beneath the skin of my abdomen, but you will never be able to do any more that shift or squirm, as I have forever made within my gut the very definition of a deep and perfect home for you, my beloved..."

*the woman's hand now slides up the skin of the little little buldge, just above the skin of her lower tummy, a little bit closer to the base of her abdomen*

"...and my gut is a home you will never leave, or even want to leave, my precious one..."
# Sadie:
now be a good little girl and dissolve~
turn into fat on my thighs~
# Typh:
"I will dissolve in my beloved's gut, and my body will serve as a feast for them, an offering of love and pleasure and warmth like nothing they ever have felt before, my precious one, and I will give them all that I am, a gift to be absorbed into their very body, to become fat on their thighs, and a part of a woman that they will know forever..."

*the woman's hand is now caressing a little bit quicker over the very little little buldge in her gut*

"Mmmmm.... oh yes... this is the perfect home..."

"you are mine... and I am yours... now... and forever..."

*the woman's hand now slides across the skin of the little little buldge, just above her tummy*

"...and your last and best gift to me... is to become a part of me... in this most deep and perfect home inside my gut..."

*the woman's hand then slides in a little lower, and begins a loving and almost affectionate patting of her stomach*

"...you will make a deep and satisfying and most perfect meal"

"I cannot wait to feel your body become mine, and your very essence will become the very fat on my thighs.... your body... now a most satisfying feast... and I... will be a woman who has never felt such deep pleasure as what I will feel from you now..."

*the woman's hand now pats the little little little buldge in her gut more firmly, and even a slightly loving little little little rub over the skin as well*

"...you are mine... and I am yours... and there is no love greater than the love inside my gut..."

"I have a deep and all consuming love for you, my beloved... and my gut is the most deep and perfect place for you... deep enough that I can even feel you wriggling about..."

*the woman's hand continues to pat and rub in a deep and loving way over the slight little buldge in her stomach, the touch soft, tender, and more than a little bit affectionate as she continues her little loving caress of her gut*

"...you are mine forever... and I cannot wait to feel you inside of me..."
# Sadie:
*after only a single hour, sadies belly is flat and toned, her thighs are an inch thicker and softer, and all evidence of typhs existence is gone*
# Typh:
"Ahhhh...... finally..."

*a deep and satisfied little sigh escapes from the woman's lips as she gently pats the very flat and toned skin of her abdomen*

"...it's like you were never even here..."

*the woman's hand then slides a little bit higher, and pats the surface of her now warm and toned thighs, the skin now much more supple and soft to the very touch*

"and these... my thighs... now more warm, soft, and round... will look so perfect and fine with my jeans, shorts, or a skirt... and the memory of you will fill me with deep satisfaction and love, for you have forever become a part of me inside of my body..."

*she continues to pat her thighs, the soft and supple skin now much more satisfying to caress, and a warm and deep satisfaction now filling the woman*
# Sadie:
*sadie lies down and falls asleep, enjoying her new, thicker, softer, more beautiful thighs, knowing that typhs sacrifice created them*
# Typh:
*the woman, now lying down, lets out a deep, soft, and loving little sigh as she looks down at her thighs and gently runs a hand over the now warm and very toned skin*

"I cannot wait to see these thighs in a pair of shorts..... or as I lie on my side and cuddle up with someone, with their hands caressing and kneading the very body parts that I could never have gained without them being inside my belly.... and I know that these thighs will give me a very deep satisfaction for many long and warm summer months"
