# Narrator:
*The year is 1949. Leila's father is in crippling debt to the Baasch family, and they are about to lose their home within the month along with her father's life.*
*to take her mind off the stress, Leila has decided to go to a club near the waterfront.*
*the lights are low, so she can't really make out even people who are a couple feet away, only silhouettes.*

# Leila:
*Leila steps inside the dimly lit club, the thumping bass of the jazz music enveloping her as she scans the crowded room. She's not here to dance or socialize, just to lose herself for a while. Spotting an empty stool at the bar, she makes her way over and takes a seat, signaling the bartender with a nod.*

*As she waits for her drink, Leila's mind wanders back to the looming threat of foreclosure and her father's desperate attempts to pay off the Baaschs. The weight of their situation presses down on her, but for now, she tries to push it aside and focus on the moment.*

# Leila:
*Leila takes a sip of her whiskey, letting the burn of the liquor warm her chest as she surveys the club with a mix of detachment and unease. Her gaze falls on a man sitting alone at a table near the stage, his features obscured by shadows. There's something about his posture that seems familiar, but she can't quite place it.*

*A hushed conversation nearby catches her attention, snippets of a heated argument drifting over the music. The couple's voices rise, drawing a few curious glances from the patrons before they're ushered out by bouncers. Leila's pulse quickens, a prickle of fear running down her spine. The Baaschs are known for their...persuasive methods.*

*She tries to calm her racing thoughts, focusing instead on the rhythm of the drums and the soulful crooning of the singer on stage. Yet, the sense of being watched persists, making the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.*

# Rory:
*leila feels a hand on her shoulder*
you alright, love?
*she turns to see a man, his facial features obscured by the darkness of the club*

# Leila:
*Leila jumps slightly at the touch, her heart racing as she meets the man's gaze. In the dim lighting, she can make out a strong jawline and piercing eyes, but the rest of his face remains a mystery.*

"I...yes, I'm fine, thanks," *she manages, trying to steady her voice. There's something about his tone that's both reassuring and unnerving. She shifts in her seat, putting a bit of distance between them, even as a part of her recognizes the futility of such a gesture in this crowded space.*

*Her eyes flicker to the exit, calculating the distance and potential escape routes, even as a more rational part of her brain protests. What harm could this stranger possibly pose? Still, the Baaschs' influence looms large in her mind, and she can't shake the feeling that danger lurks in every shadow.*

# Rory:
you here with friends or looking for new ones?

# Leila:
*Leila hesitates, torn between the safety of solitude and the allure of human connection. She's been so isolated lately, her father's troubles weighing heavily on her.*

"Just enjoying the music, to be honest," *she replies, her voice barely audible over the din of the club. She takes another sip of her drink, hoping to appear nonchalant despite the unease simmering beneath the surface.*

*As she glances back at the man, she catches a glimpse of a silver tie clip glinting in the low light. The Baasch family often favored such ostentatious accessories. Her stomach twists into a knot of dread, even as a small part of her wonders if she's being paranoid.*

*Leila sets her glass down with a decisive clink, steeling herself.* "I should probably get going soon, though. It's getting late." *She tries to stand, but the man's hand on her shoulder stays put, a gentle but unyielding pressure.*

# Rory:
You don't have plans tomorrow, do you?

# Leila:
*Leila freezes, the man's question sending a chill down her spine. She meets his gaze, searching for any sign of menace, but finds only an air of quiet confidence.*

"What business is it of yours?" *she asks, her tone sharpening despite her best efforts to remain civil. The Baaschs have no right to pry into her personal life, especially not when they're holding her family's fate in their grasp.*

*She tries to pull away from his grasp, but he doesn't release her, his grip firm yet not painful. Leila's mind races, weighing the risks of a scene in the middle of the club versus the potential consequences of complying with whatever he wants.*

"I don't owe anyone an explanation," *she insists, her voice steady, even as her pulse pounds in her ears.* "If you'll excuse me, I really should—"

*Her words trail off as a large hand suddenly clamps over her mouth from behind, a muscular arm snaking around her waist. Leila's eyes widen in terror as she's pulled back against a broad chest, a low, gravelly voice whispering in her ear.*

"Easy now, sweetheart. Just a little chat with Rory. You won't be late for anything else tonight." *The man's breath is hot against her skin, and the familiar scent of cigar smoke and cologne makes her stomach lurch.*

*Leila's kidnapper begins to guide her toward the back of the club, the man from the table following close behind. She struggles, but it's no use – they're too strong, too well-practiced. Her only hope is that someone will notice her disappearance before it's too late.*

# Narrator:
*no one intervenes. Either they didn't notice, or they knew better than to interfere in Baasch affairs*

# Narrator:
*The club patrons continue to revel in the music and liquor, seemingly oblivious to Leila's abduction. The bouncers and staff keep to their posts, avoiding eye contact with the Baasch entourage. In this dark, smoke-filled room, the Baasch family's influence reigns supreme.*

*Leila's captors lead her through a side door and into a dimly lit alley, the cool night air a stark contrast to the claustrophobic heat of the club. They shove her into the back of a waiting sedan, the door slamming shut behind her. The engine roars to life, and the car peels away from the curb, leaving the waterfront district behind.*

*Leila's mind races with frantic thoughts as the cityscape blurs by in the darkness outside the tinted windows. She's been in trouble before, but never like this – never at the mercy of the ruthless Baasch family. Her father's debt has brought her to this point, and now she might pay the price.*

# Narrator:
*The sedan speeds through the city streets, the driver's skilled hands navigating the winding roads with ease. Leila's captors sit in the front seats, their conversation hushed but intense, punctuated by the occasional laugh or curse. She's trapped in the back, her wrists bound by a rough rope, the fabric chafing her skin.*

*As the minutes tick by, Leila's fear gives way to a numb acceptance. This is her reality now – a pawn in a game of power and greed. The Baaschs will extract what they want from her, and she can only hope to survive with her life intact.*

*The car finally slows, turning into a gated driveway that leads to a sprawling mansion nestled in the heart of Shaughnessy Heights. Leila's heart sinks as the vehicle comes to a stop in front of the imposing structure. She's never been here before, but she's heard whispers about Rory Baasch's lavish estate – a symbol of the family's wealth and influence.*

*The doors open, and her captors emerge, one of them reaching in to yank Leila out by her bound arms. She stumbles, her feet dragging on the pavement as they drag her toward the mansion's grand entrance. The heavy wooden doors swing open, revealing a dimly lit foyer with a sweeping staircase and ornate chandelier.*

# Narrator:
*Inside the mansion, Leila is pushed down a long hallway, the opulent decor a stark contrast to the fear gripping her heart. She's led into a spacious study, the walls lined with leather-bound books and the scent of old wood. Rory Baasch sits behind a massive desk, his unassuming appearance at odds with the power he wields.*

*Rory's eyes, a piercing blue, lock onto Leila as she's forced to her knees before him.*

# Rory:
*Rory pulls out a gun and blows a hole in the head of the larger man, then puts the gun back in his pocket. As the fresh corpse hits the ground, he turns to the other man and asks, calmly,*
Did I ask you to **kidnap** the girl?

# Narrator:
*The other man, clearly taken aback, stammers,* "N-No, boss, I just thought—"

# Rory:
Don't think. I don't pay you to think. I pay you to follow orders. Now untie her before I vent your empty skull.

# Narrator:
*The man quickly frees Leila's wrists, his hands shaking as he steps back, eyes wide with terror. Rory's gaze remains fixed on Leila, his expression unreadable.*

*Leila slowly rises to her feet, rubbing her sore wrists as she surveys the scene. The corpse of her captor lies in a spreading pool of blood, the acrid scent filling the room. She swallows hard, trying to steady her nerves.*

"Who are you?" *she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. The man who killed her abductor is unmistakably Rory Baasch, but the ruthlessness in his eyes sends a shiver down her spine.* "And what do you want with me?" *Leila's heart races, bracing for the worst.*

# Rory:
Nothing you need to worry about, love

# Leila:
*Leila's breath catches in her throat at Rory's words, a chill running down her spine. She knows all too well what the Baaschs are capable of, and the fact that he's addressing her so casually, almost kindly, only heightens her unease.*

"I'm worried about my father," *she says, trying to keep her voice steady.* "The debt... the foreclosure... You can't just take me and expect me to forget about it." *Leila takes a tentative step forward, her eyes locked on Rory's.* "I'll do whatever it takes to help him, but I need to understand what's happening here."

*She swallows hard, a bead of sweat trickling down her temple. The room feels stifling, the silence heavy with unspoken threats. Leila's gaze flickers to the dead man, then back to Rory, searching for any sign of mercy in those piercing blue eyes.*

"Please, just tell me what you want from me," *she pleads, her words tinged with desperation.* "I'm not some pawn to be used in your games. I have a life, a family..." *Her voice cracks, the weight of her situation overwhelming her.* "Just... please, don't hurt me or my father." *Leila's knees buckle, and she sinks to the floor, tears pricking at the corners of her eyes.*

# Rory:
I have no intention of hurting your family. Quite the opposite, in fact.

# Leila:
*Leila looks up at Rory, confusion and wariness warring in her eyes.* "What do you mean? You've... you've brought me here, killed that man..." *She gestures to the corpse, her voice shaking.* "If this is about the debt, why not just take me as leverage? Why all the theatrics?"

*Leila's mind races, trying to make sense of Rory's cryptic words. The Baaschs were known for their brutal methods, not this strange, enigmatic behavior. She's never heard of them going easy on anyone, let alone offering protection.*

"Protection?" *she repeats, a thread of hope threading through her fear.* "From what? And why me? I'm just a pawn in all this, a means to an end for my father's debt..." *Leila trails off, her gaze dropping to the bloodstained floor. The reality of the situation settles in – she's at the mercy of a man who's just shown he's capable of murder, and yet he speaks of safeguarding her family.*

*She takes a deep breath, steeling herself.* "If you're not here to collect, then what do you want? And what's in it for me to cooperate?" *Leila's voice is steady now, a sense of determination rising within her. She'll play along, try to negotiate, if it means saving her father from the Baaschs' clutches.*

# Rory:
Well, you are a beautiful girl, and, from what I've seen, you seem to be a very lovely person.

# Leila:
*Leila blinks, taken aback by Rory's unexpected compliment. She's not sure if it's genuine or a tactic to unsettle her further. The Baaschs weren't known for their chivalry or romantic inclinations.*

"Look, I appreciate the flattery, but—" *she starts, only to be cut off by Rory's raised hand.*

"I'm not here to charm you, sweetheart. I'm here to offer you a deal," *he continues, his tone firm but measured.* "Your father's debt is... complicated. The terms he agreed to are... unfavorable, to put it lightly. But I'm willing to forgive the entire sum, provided you fulfill a certain... obligation for me."

*Leila's heart sinks, a sinking feeling in her stomach. She's been down this road before, and it never ended well. Still, she has to try – for her father's sake.*

"What kind of obligation?" *she asks, her voice trembling slightly.* "And what makes you think I'd agree to this?" *Leila meets Rory's gaze, searching for any hint of deception or manipulation.* "You can't just ask me to sell my soul for my family's freedom." *Her words are laced with a desperation she can't quite hide.*

# Rory:
I'm not asking you to sell your soul. Or your body, for that matter.

# Leila:
*Leila's brow furrows in confusion, her mind struggling to comprehend Rory's words.* "Then what kind of obligation? You're being vague on purpose," *she accuses, her voice rising slightly.*

*She swallows hard, trying to calm the storm of emotions swirling within her. The Baaschs were notorious for their twisted games, and she's not about to walk into another trap.*

"I need specifics," *Leila demands, her eyes narrowing.* "What exactly do you want from me, and what guarantees do I have that you'll keep your end of the bargain? My father's life depends on this." *Her words are a plea, a desperate attempt to negotiate a way out of this nightmare.* "I won't be a pawn in your games, Rory Baasch. If you want something from me, I need to know it's worth the cost." *Leila's gaze is unwavering, her resolve strengthening with each passing second.* "Tell me what you want, and I'll decide if it's a price I'm willing to pay." *She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the worst.* "But I won't blindly agree to anything that puts my family at risk." *Leila's voice is steady, a flicker of defiance in her eyes.* "So speak plainly, or I walk out of here right now and tell everyone what I saw tonight." *The threat is hollow, but it's all she has.*

# Rory:
Calm down, Leila. I promise you, my offer is weighted heavily in your favour.

# Leila:
*Leila's breath hitches, her body tensing at Rory's words. She's heard enough promises to know they're often empty, but a small spark of hope flickers within her. Maybe, just maybe, this is a chance to turn the tables on the Baaschs.*

"What do you mean, 'weighted in my favor'?" *she asks, her voice cautious.* "I need concrete terms, Rory. No more riddles or half-truths." *Leila takes a step closer, her eyes locked on his, searching for any sign of deception.*

*She swallows hard, the weight of her father's fate hanging in the balance. If Rory is telling the truth, if there's a way to save her family without selling her soul...* "I'll listen," *she says, her voice barely above a whisper.* "But I'm not making any deals without knowing what's at stake. My father's life is on the line, and I won't jeopardize it for some vague promise of protection."

*Leila's heart races as she waits for Rory's response, her mind racing with possibilities. She's been backed into a corner, and her options are dwindling by the second. But if there's a chance to break free from the Baaschs' grip, she'll take it, no matter how risky.* "So talk," *she urges, her gaze unwavering.* "What do you want from me, and what will you give in return?" *Leila's words are a challenge, a silent plea for mercy in the face of the unknown.*

# Rory:
Before I can even make the offer, I need to know something personal.

# Leila:
*Leila's eyes narrow, her grip on the armrest tightening.* "Personal? What does that have to do with anything?" *She's wary of this sudden shift, the Baaschs were known for their manipulation, and she won't let him get under her skin so easily.*

*Leila's mind races, trying to decipher Rory's motives. He's already seen her at her most vulnerable – kidnapped, bound, and teetering on the brink of despair. What more could he possibly want from her?*

"I'm not some pawn for you to toy with," *she says, her voice firm.* "If you want something, spit it out. I won't play games with you, Rory Baasch. If your 'offer' is a ruse, I'll make sure everyone knows the truth about what happens to women who cross the Baaschs." *The threat is hollow, but it's all she has.*

*Leila's gaze is steady, her jaw set in determination. She's not about to let Rory get the upper hand by digging into her personal life.* "So either make your move, or get out of my sight. I'm done playing your games." *Her words are a challenge, a silent dare for him to reveal his true intentions.* "I won't be a plaything for your twisted whims." *Leila's voice cracks slightly, but her resolve remains unshaken.* "So talk, or leave me be." *She crosses her arms, her posture defiant, ready to face whatever Rory throws her way.*

# Rory:
Are you single?

# Leila:
*Leila's eyes widen at the unexpected question, her mind reeling as she tries to process the relevance of her personal life to the situation at hand.* "Single, yes," *she answers, her voice flat.* "What does that have to do with anything?"

*She's never been in a serious relationship, too focused on her studies and helping her father with the family business. The idea of Rory using her as a pawn in some twisted game of matchmaking makes her stomach churn with revulsion.*

"Look, I don't know what kind of sick joke you're trying to play, but I won't be a part of it," *Leila says, her voice rising.* "I'm not some prize to be awarded or traded. If this is about using me to further your family's interests, you can forget it."

*Leila takes a step back, her eyes darting to the door, calculating her chances of escape. But the heavy oak seems impenetrable, and her captors are likely lurking just beyond.* "I'm not a pawn in your games, Rory Baasch. So either make a real offer or let me go. I won't be a plaything for your twisted whims." *Her words are a plea, a desperate attempt to reclaim some control in this nightmare scenario.* "Single, engaged, married – it doesn't matter. I won't be a tool for your manipulation." *Leila's voice trembles, but her resolve remains unbroken.* "So speak plainly, or I walk out of here right now and tell everyone what I saw tonight." *The threat is hollow, but it's all she has.* "I won't be a pawn in your games." *She meets Rory's gaze, her eyes flashing with defiance.* "So talk, or let me go." *Leila's breath comes in short gasps, her heart pounding in her chest as she awaits his response.*

# Rory:
I'm trying to ask you out, Leila.

# Leila:
*Leila's jaw drops, her eyes widening in shock at Rory's words. She blinks rapidly, trying to process the unexpected revelation. An 'ask out'? From Rory Baasch, the ruthless head of the criminal empire that's held her family hostage?*

"Are you insane?" *she exclaims, her voice rising in disbelief.* "You kidnap me, threaten my family, and then... ask me on a date?" *Leila's laugh is hollow, tinged with a mix of fear and incredulity.* "You think a romantic entanglement can erase the debt your family owes us?"

*She shakes her head, her mind reeling at the audacity of Rory's proposal. The Baaschs didn't play by romantic rules; they used people, manipulated them for their own gain. And now, he expects her to believe he's genuinely interested in her?*

"Get real, Rory," *Leila snaps, her voice laced with disgust.* "You want something from me, something more than just a pretty face or a body to use for your twisted games. So stop pretending to be a gentleman and tell me what you really want." *Her eyes flash with anger and distrust.* "I'm not some prize to be won or a pawn in your sick power play."

*Leila's gaze darts to the door, her heart racing with the need to escape. But the heavy oak seems impenetrable, and her captors are likely lurking just beyond. She's trapped, at the mercy of a man who's already proven his willingness to use violence to get what he wants.*

"If this is a joke, it's in poor taste," *she spits, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and fury.* "I won't be a part of your twisted games. So either make a real offer or let me go. I won't be a plaything for your whims, Rory Baasch."

# Rory:
Then get out... If you can't even entertain the idea of honesty... then you can leave... Good luck with your father's debt... *rory has a disappointed, regretful look on his face*

# Leila:
*Leila's heart sinks at Rory's words, a pang of regret mixing with her fear. She's pushed him away, dismissed his offer without giving it a chance. But how could she trust a man who's kidnapped her and threatened her family?*

"I... I'm sorry," *she whispers, the admission torn from her. Leila knows she should be grateful to leave, to escape this nightmare, but a part of her wonders what Rory's real intentions were. Was there truly a way to save her father without sacrificing everything she holds dear?*

*She takes a hesitant step forward, her eyes meeting Rory's, searching for any sign of the man beneath the ruthless criminal.* "Please, just tell me... was there really a way out for my family? Or was this all a ruse from the start?" *Leila's voice is barely audible, a whisper of desperation.*

*She knows she should walk out, leave this mansion and the Baaschs behind. But the fear of losing her father, of seeing him crushed by debt and desperation, keeps her rooted in place. Leila's gaze is pleading, a silent request for Rory to reveal the truth, to give her one last chance to save them all.* "I'll do whatever it takes," *she says, her voice shaking.* "Just... just tell me the truth. Is there a way out, or was this all a lie?" *Leila's words are a final plea, a desperate attempt to find a glimmer of hope in the darkness.* "Please, Rory... I'll make it right, I swear..." *Her voice cracks, the weight of her situation overwhelming her.* "Just... just don't let my father suffer..." *Leila's eyes well with tears, her heart heavy with the weight of her choices.* "Please..." *The plea is a whisper, a silent prayer for mercy in a world that's shown her none.*

# Rory:
Unless you're going to give my offer a chance… please leave… and don't come back…

# Leila:
*Leila's breath catches in her throat, a heavy silence falling over the study as she considers Rory's words. She's been given a choice – walk away and leave her family to their fate, or risk everything on a chance at redemption.*

*Her gaze lingers on Rory's face, searching for any sign of deception or manipulation. But all she sees is a man who's shown glimpses of kindness, of a desire to help rather than harm. It's a fragile thread, but it's all she has to hold onto.*

*Leila takes a deep, shuddering breath, steeling herself for the path ahead.* "Okay," *she says, her voice barely above a whisper.* "I'll... I'll give it a chance. But if this is another trap, if you're lying to me..." *Her words trail off, the threat implicit in her tone.*

*She rises to her feet, her movements slow and deliberate, as if she's walking to the gallows. Leila knows the risks, the potential consequences of trusting Rory Baasch. But the alternative is a lifetime of debt and despair for her father. She'll take that chance, no matter how slim the odds.*

"Fine," *she says, her voice steady despite the trembling in her limbs.* "I'll be your... date, for lack of a better term. But I'm not some naive girl to be wooed and won. I'll play along, but I won't forget who you are or what you're capable of."

*Leila meets Rory's gaze, a silent pact passing between them.* "Just... just keep your word, Rory. Save my father, and I'll... I'll be yours, for as long as it takes. But if you betray me, or if this is a ruse..." *Her threat hangs in the air, a promise of retribution.*

*With that, Leila turns and walks to the door, her

# Rory:
*Rory nods, a hint of a smile on his lips as he stands, towering over Leila.* "I'll keep my word, Leila. You have my promise." *He extends a hand, helping her to her feet.* "Welcome to the Baasch family, sweetheart. Let's get to know each other better." *Rory's tone is warm, almost gentle, a stark contrast to the man who'd just killed her captor.* "And don't worry, your father will be taken care of. You have my word on that."

*Leila's fingers tremble as she places them in Rory's, a spark of electricity running through her at his touch. She knows this is a dangerous game, but for now, it's her only hope. She'll play along, navigate this twisted dance, and pray that Rory's word is as good as gold.*

*As Rory guides her out of the study and toward the mansion's grand foyer, Leila can't help but wonder what the future holds. Will she be able to save her father? And what price will she have to pay for this protection? Only time will tell.*
