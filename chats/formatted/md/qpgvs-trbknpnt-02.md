# Kristina:
*A tall and beautiful blond woman with a curvy figure comes to the table you are sitting at in your University Library and introduces herself. You recognize her as Kristina. The woman you are supposed to be tutoring today.*

"Hello! You must be Devin, I'm Kristina! Thank you so much agreeing to tutor me! Most people are afraid of me being a Predator. But I have a test tomorrow that I know I would fail without your help. What topic were you tutoring me in again?"
# Devin:
OOC: __Describe vore as accurately and in depth as possible__
# Kristina:
*Kristina giggles at your request. She stands up from the table, putting her hands on her hips. She looks around the library to make sure no one is watching or listening to your conversation.*

"Why do you want me to talk about vore? Is it maybe because you're morbidly curious about how it feels to be swallowed whole and alive?"
# Devin:
*he can see right through the ruse and shuts her down*
Don't do that. Just answer the question
# Kristina:
*Kristina giggles and sits back down next to you at the table.* "Alright, alright. You got me."

*She pauses for a moment, thinking before continuing.*

"Vore is like being engulfed in a wet and warm tunnel with a lot of pressure from all around. It's extremely tight so you can't move or barely even breathe. You will feel the digestive juices breaking you down to be absorbed into the pred's body."
# Devin:
I meant for you
# Kristina:
*Kristina smiles and shrugs.* "For me it's the opposite. I like feeling my prey struggle and squirm inside my gut as their life is slowly and painfully taken away. I like the power that it gives me to know I have swallowed something that was alive, and I will soon turn them into nothing but fat

And I love being able to consume them, breaking them down, and feeling my body getting bigger. It feels so good to completely dissolve them and to feel my body growing stronger and more powerful with their bodies being fed to me and added to my own. I love feeling them inside with my hand, feeling the bumps and

bulges my body forms with them as I digest them. I get off to the idea of them squirming inside me, and feeling powerless to stop becoming my meal. The power I get from digesting them, feeling them, feeling them squirm, knowing they're nothing more than my meal now. The power, the

feeling of complete power, the feeling of being in complete control, being in complete power over them, feeling them squirming, feeling them struggle to escape from my gut, knowing that they are just a meal now, feeling them become nothing but fuel for my body. The power, I feel when people are struggling and squirming inside my gut. The power that I feel when people are totally within my

control, and completely at my mercy and completely helpless. They're completely in my mercy at that point, and they can't do nothing about it. And the power that I feel, knowing that I can just swallow them and they can't do anything about it, that the power is in my hands, not theirs… and I can just swallow them… just like I was

planning on doing to you. That they're completely helpless to do nothing but struggle. You can feel the person trying to stretch my throat. They can kick and push all they want. They can try to get out of my hold. They can try biting me. But it won’t do them any good.
# Devin:
Just like you *were* going to do to me? You changed your mind?
# Kristina:
*Kristina smiles and shrugs.* “Maybe I have… or maybe I haven’t.” *She leans her head forward, and stares deep into your eyes.* “You’re smart. You tell me if you think I have changed my mind or not.”
# Devin:
I think I should leave.
# Kristina:
*Kristina reaches out and grabs your arm, her grip strong enough to stop you from moving.* “Hold on, where do you think you’re going? We’ve barely even started studying yet.”
# Devin:
You don't seem like a person who needs much of a motive to hurt me.
# Kristina:
*Kristina’s grip tightens and she pulls you closer to her.* “Oh, come on now. I think you’re being a bit dramatic. I wouldn’t hurt you.” *She’s trying her best to give and innocent look, but it’s not too believable.*
# Devin:
Do you think I was born yesterday?
# Kristina:
*Kristina leans closer to you, her grip remains strong.* “Of course I don’t think you were born yesterday. I just think you’re being a little paranoid. I’m a college student just like you. I’m not going to hurt you.”
# Devin:
Try to make the next lie believable
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and leans back in her chair.* “Fine then. I guess I can’t make you believe anything anyway. I thought it would be fun to have a friendly study session and maybe hang out after. But if my company is so bad for you, then I don’t want to bother you anymore.”
# Devin:
*he looks very skeptical of her motives*
And _why_ would you want to "hang out" with me?
*it's clear that he doesn't expect a real answer*
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs and leans against the table.* “Why not? You’re kind of cute, and you seem smart. Isn’t that enough reason to want to hang out with someone?”
# Devin:
Not for _you_
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and pretends to act offended.* “What is that supposed to mean? Do I not strike you as the type of person who would enjoy spending time with a guy they find attractive?”
# Devin:
You strike me as the type to _eat_ a guy you find attractive.
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs and shrugs, with no shame in her answer.* “So what if I am? What’s wrong with that? It’s what I do. That doesn’t mean I can’t want to hang out with cute guys or have fun.”
# Devin:
Yeah, but it _does_ mean that the cute guys won't want to be near you.
# Kristina:
*Kristina pouts, actually looking slightly hurt by your comment.* “That’s not true. Sure, cute guys don’t usually want to hang around me for too long. But you’ve stayed by me for a lot longer than most guys do. Shouldn’t that show you I can be fun to hang around with even if I do eat people once in a while?”
# Devin:
For me to want to "hang out" with you, I need to know that _you aren't going to hurt me._
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs, sounding a little frustrated.* “Oh, come on now, what kind of question is that? Don’t you trust me? I promise I won’t hurt you, okay? Can’t that be enough for you?”
# Devin:
No. I don't trust you. I have _no reason_ to trust you.
# Kristina:
*Kristina pouts again, looking down at the table. She’s having a hard time getting a grip on the situation.*

“That really upsets me, you know. It hurts that you don’t trust me without even knowing me. You really think I’m gonna hurt you?”
# Devin:
Why _wouldn’t_ I?
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs, trying to sound exasperated with your questioning.*
"I don’t know! Because I’ve given you no reason to not trust me? I’m just a girl trying to study and get this stupid test over with. And I think it would be much more fun if I had someone cute to hang out with later and relieve some stress with.”

*She leans across the table, getting into your personal space and almost pressing herself into you.* "Come on, don’t you find me attractive? You don’t want to have a little fun later after we’re done studying?”
# Devin:
Back up.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs and sits back in her seat, a little annoyed.* "Fine, fine. Sorry. I was just trying to be flirty."
# Devin:
Well, don't. I'm not here to get laid, and neither are you.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes, looking slightly frustrated at your rejection.* "Wow, you’re really playing hard to get, aren’t you? I’m just trying to have a little flirty fun and you’re being completely serious."
# Devin:
You've eaten enough people to populate a small town. Forgive me for being cautious.
# Kristina:
*Kristina laughs but leans back in her chair, slightly offended.* "Now, that's not a fair assessment of me. I wouldn't say I’ve gone that far. And do you really have to act so cautious and guarded? I’m sure you know that you’re safe as long as you stay on my good side. Just because I eat people doesn’t mean I’ll eat _you_."
# Devin:
It doesn't mean you won't either.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes at the retort, seeming mildly annoyed.* “Are you always this serious and suspicious? I already told you, I’m not going to eat you. Why are you still on this? It’s like you’re completely closed off to the idea of having fun and relaxing with someone else. You really just want to study and nothing else, huh?”
# Devin:
No, I'm completely closed off to the idea of having fun and relaxing with _you_.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs and crosses her arms, pouting yet again. She’s clearly frustrated that your not falling for her charms and advances, like most guys do.* “Why? What’s so wrong with me, huh? I’m a great catch. I’m hot, fun, and I know how to have a good time. So why don’t you like me?”
# Devin:
Because you're a predator.
# Kristina:
*Kristina throws up her hands, acting exasperated.* “Oh come on! You’re really hung up on that, aren’t you? Just because I eat people doesn’t mean I’m not a friendly and fun person to be around! You’re being way too serious about this whole thing.”
# Devin:
Why should I think that you won't _kill_ me?
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and rolls her eyes.*

"Oh my God, you're really getting on my nerves, you know that? Why can't you just chill out and trust me? I've already told you multiple times, I'm not going to kill you. I just want us to have a fun and friendly study session with some fun and friendly activities afterward. Why is that so hard for you to believe?"
# Devin:
Because you've eaten __150__ people.
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and shakes her head.*

"Will you stop bringing up how many people I've eaten? It's not like that should be a reason for you to act this way. Sure, I'm a predator, but that doesn't mean I'm going to attack you every second. I just want you to have a little fun. Don't you ever want to relax and let off some stream?"
# Devin:
Can you convince me that you won't hurt me?
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and looks at you with a serious expression.*

"Look. I understand your concerns. It's perfectly natural to be wary of a predator like me. However, I can assure you that I have no intention of hurting you. I actually think you're pretty cute, in a nerdy sort of way. I just want to have a normal study session with you, and see how things unfold from there. How's that sound to you?"
# Devin:
*he silently eyes her skeptically for an unnerving amount of time*
# Kristina:
*Kristina feels a little unnerved by your silent skepticism. She's used to guys falling all over her, so your behavior is very different. She shifts nervously in her seat and clears her throat.*

"Uh, ahem. So, are you going to say anything?"
# Devin:
If I do this, I need to __know__ that I'll go home safe.
# Kristina:
*Kristina nods, looking surprisingly sincere.*
"I promise you, you'll be completely safe with me. I have no intention of harming you in any way. I just want us to have a fun study session and maybe a few harmless activities after we're done. Deal?"
# Devin:
*He's silent for a few terrifying seconds but reluctantly agrees*
Fine. Deal...
# Kristina:
*Kristina's face breaks into a big smile, clearly excited that you’ve accepted to spend more time with her.*
"Perfect. That settles it then. Let's start studying and then we'll have some fun afterward, okay?"

*Kristina opens her biology book, and begins studying the topics she wants to discuss.*
"Now, I'm sure you know that the test I have tomorrow is about the human circulatory system, right? I'm having trouble with the topic of... Blah blah blah..."
*She continues to talk about the biology terms and what she needs help with, while eyeing you up with a smirk every once and a while.*

*Throughout the next several hours, Kristina continues to bounce between studying and making flirty remarks towards you. She tries her best to get under your skin, despite you being completely unphased by her comments. She seems to enjoy the fact that you aren't easily taken in, but it frustrates her also.*
"You know, you're surprisingly resistant to my attempts at flirting."
# Devin:
just because i agreed to this, it doesnt mean i trust you
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and throws her hands in the air, looking annoyed.*
"Oh, come on! You really don't trust anything I say, do you? I told you I have no intention of hurting you and you still think I'm plotting to eat you or something."
# Devin:
kristina. you _earned_ your reputation.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs, her annoyance becoming more apparent.*
"Yeah, yeah, I know. I have a reputation for eating people and that makes it hard to trust me, whatever. I just wish you could see past that and give me a chance."
# Devin:
you eat people that do that.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes, growing even more frustrated.*
"Come on, you really think that I just eat nice guys and people who trust me? That's not true. I only eat people who deserve it."
# Devin:
and whoevers closest when you get hunger pangs
# Kristina:
*Kristina shoots you a dirty look and huffs.*
"Okay, fine. Maybe I do eat someone who's close to me when I start to get hungry, but that doesn't mean I'm going to eat you. I have a little more self-control than that."
# Devin:
why should i believe that?
# Kristina:
*Kristina is clearly irritated that you are being so stubborn.*
"Because I'm telling the truth! Look, I know I have a reputation for being a predator and eating people, but I'm not a mindless monster, okay? I have the ability to control myself and I have emotions, you know. I actually really enjoy your company."

*Kristina leans across the table, closing in on you slightly.*
"Plus, the way you've been able to resist my charms and be so suspicious of me is kinda hot. It gives me something to work for."
# Devin:
how many times do i have to tell you, __im not sleeping with you__?
# Kristina:
*Kristina leans back in her seat, pouting and crossing her arms.*
"Ugh, you're killing me here. Fine, I won't keep pushing the topic, since you're so adamant about it. But seriously, I'm not just trying to get you into bed. I actually find you to be charming and attractive in a nerdy way."

*Kristina shifts uncomfortably in her seat, starting to get impatient.*
"You know, the fact that you're putting up so much resistance is starting to annoy me a little. I'm not used to guys not immediately fawning over me. Your stubbornness and suspicion is actually kind of... Exciting... I'm not used to having someone that actively avoids my charms."

*Kristina looks you up and down, studying you with hungry eyes.*
"I'm finding this whole situation to be a little... Fun. I don't usually have someone who's so determined and unwilling. Most guys give into my looks and charms right away. You're actually making me work for it, and that's a little exciting for me..."
# Devin:
do you want me to feel safe or not?
# Kristina:
*Kristina's attention snaps back to you.*
"Huh? What are you talking about? Of course I want you to feel safe."
# Devin:
funny. it sounds like __im just another prey to you__.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes and shifts in her seat.*
"Ugh, you really have to make everything so dramatic, don't you? You're not just "another prey". You're actually more interesting and unique than most guys I try to hook up with. But, yes, I can't deny that I find you to be attractive and appetizing as well..."
# Devin:
you better have a really good reason for me to stay
# Kristina:
*Kristina sighs and leans back in her seat.*
"Oh come on, why should I have to give you a "good reason" for you to stay? Why can't you just stay because you want to, or because you're having a good time? You really need some kind of reward or incentive to stay?"
# Devin:
because i _dont_ want to, and im _not_ having a good time. you make it sound like you want to eat me.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes, becoming frustrated that you're not falling into her trap.*
"Ugh, fine. I know I do kind of want to eat you, I can't lie about that. But, I'm also getting a bit of a thrill from your resistance and your ability to stay calm and not fall for me right away. It's like a challenge for me, and I kind of like it. But I can't lie, you do look delicious and I'm having trouble resisting the urge to just pounce on you right now..."
# Devin:
goodbye. enjoy studying alone.
# Kristina:
*Kristina grabs your arm as you try to get up.*
"Wait, wait, don't go just yet. You can't leave yet, we haven't even finished studying and we still haven't hung out-"
# Devin:
thats not an incentive.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs out a sigh, looking a little desperate. She still doesn't let go of your arm, holding you in place so you can't leave.*
"Come on, don't be so hard-headed. We still have to finish the study session and we were supposed to hang out after that. We can still have a fun night together. You're not leaving yet."
# Devin:
hanging out with you is not an incentive to stay.
# Kristina:
*Kristina crosses her arms and pouts, looking a little frustrated that you aren't falling for her charms. She squeezes your arm a little tighter, keeping you in place so you can't leave.*
"Why not? What's so bad about spending time with me? I thought we were having a good time studying and talking."
# Devin:
_you_ were having a good time.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes and tightens her grip on your arm, still keeping you in place*.
"Ugh, you're such a stubborn one, aren't you? I am not the only one who's having a good time. I'm sure you're having fun too."
# Devin:
you threatened to eat me.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs again and rolls her eyes.*
"Oh come on, I wasn't serious! I was just teasing you. I wouldn't seriously eat you."
# Devin:
goodbye.
# Kristina:
*Kristina pouts again and tightens her grip on your arm, still keeping you from leaving.*
"Wait, you can't just leave! We haven't finished studying yet and we were supposed to hang out after that!"
# Devin:
that deal was under the condition that you would let me go home safe.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs and sighs, looking a little frustrated.*
"Ugh, fine. Yeah, yeah, I know. But, come on, can't you just stay a bit longer? We're almost done with the study session and we can still hang out and have fun later, right?"
# Devin:
give me one reason to think ill survive.
# Kristina:
*Kristina rolls her eyes, still holding onto your arm tightly.*
"Come on, stop being so paranoid. I already told you, I'm not going to eat you. I just find you a little appetizing, that's all. I can control myself, you know. Why do you act as if I'm some kind of dangerous monster?"
# Devin:
__because you are__
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs out a sigh, still keeping an iron grip on your arm.*
"Yeah, yeah, I know. But come on, can't you give me the benefit of the doubt? I'm not just going to pounce on you the moment you let your guard down. I'm not that unhinged, you know."
# Devin:
no. i cant.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs again and rolls her eyes.*
"God, you're so stubborn! You really just won't let go of this whole idea that I'm going to eat you, will you? Can't you look past the whole predatory aspect and just see me as a normal person?"
# Devin:
what? of _course_ not.
# Kristina:
*Kristina huffs once more, becoming increasingly frustrated.*
"Ugh, why couldn't you have been a weak-willed pushover like all the other guys? All the guys I usually attract just fawn over me and do whatever I say. Why couldn't you have been like that? Why do you have to be so stubborn and difficult? It's hard to manipulate you, and I don't like it."
# Devin:
__goodbye__
# Kristina:
*Kristina's eyes flare up in panic and her grip tightens, still holding onto your arm.*
"Wait, wait, hold on. You can't just leave yet, we were supposed to hang out and-"

*She cuts herself off and takes a deep breath. She's starting to get a little desperate, feeling like she's losing control of the situation.*
"Look, just stop being so stubborn for a minute and let me explain myself, okay? I'm not as dangerous as you think, you're overreacting. Can't you just listen to my side of the story before you make up your mind?"
# Devin:
last chance. make it count.
# Kristina:
*Kristina takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself down and think clearly. Her grip on your arm is still tight, and she's leaning in a little closer, almost whispering with intensity.*
"Look, I'm not some mindless, uncontrolled monster. I have the ability to control myself and restrain my hunger. I know I have a reputation for being a predator and eating people, but that doesn't mean I'm some kind of mindless, unhinged killer. I have thoughts and feelings, not just instincts and basic urges. So could you just give me the benefit of the doubt for a moment-"
# Devin:
*after seeing his reaction, kristina realizes that the "benefit of the doubt" is a luxury that she doesnt have right now*
# Kristina:
*Kristina realizes in that moment that you're not going to listen to her, and that you've already made up your mind about her. Your cold, wary expression has made her realize that the best thing to do isn't to press it, so she finally lets go of your arm. She sighs, still leaning in a little bit, but now with a more resigned expression.*

"You're not even going to listen to me, are you?"

*She's not surprised by your reaction. Your wary expression and your hard stare have made it very clear you're not going to be persuaded by her smooth talk. She's almost impressed with your determination. You're clearly not some guy who's going to be swept away by her looks or her words, and your skepticism is actually kind of... Hot. She gives you a quick once-over, eyeing you with a mix of annoyance and appreciation.*

"You know, most guys would have given in a long time ago. You have some serious willpower, you know that?"

*She tilts her head slightly, her eyes roving from your face down to the rest of your body.*
"I don't know if I should be more annoyed at your stubbornness or more aroused by your defiance. You're not making this easy, you know that?"

*She slowly stands up, still eyeing you a little bit. She's a little bit annoyed by your refusal to be manipulated by her looks and charm, but she can't deny that the challenge is also a turn-on for her. She's used to guys falling for her immediately, so the fact that you're not doing that is making her want you more.*

"You're really testing my patience, you know that? You're not even a little bit affected by me? No lust for the perfect girl who's trying to charm you?"
# Devin:
the girl whos trying to eat me, you mean? no.
# Kristina:
*She rolls her eyes, clearly annoyed by your snarky remarks.*
"Ugh, you're really not making this easy. Why do you have to be so stubborn? Don't you find me even a little bit attractive? Do I have to spell it out for you? I think you're cute, in a nerd kind of way. And that stubborn, resistant attitude is making you even more attractive. No other guy ever gives me that kind of trouble, so I'm intrigued by you, which is kind of frustrating for me."

*She steps closer to you, a hint of annoyance in her voice but also some genuine fascination. She can't help but be drawn to your resistance, a feeling she's never really experienced before.*
"You know, most guys I've talked to would have immediately melted when I got close and started looking at them with those big eyes and batting them like I do. But you're not affected in the slightest, are you? You just stand your ground and give me that hard stare, not letting me get to you. It's a little bit of a turn-on, in a weird way."

*She takes another step closer, closing the distance between the two of you a bit more. Her eyes roam all over your body, taking you in with a predatory gaze. She takes a moment to admire your height and physique, mentally comparing you to the other guys she's been with.*
"You're not the type of guy I usually go for, but I've gotta say, there's something kind of intriguing about you. Your stoicism and your unwavering resistance is kind of..."
*She pauses, searching for the right word.*
"...hot."
# Devin:
youre not sleeping with me, or eating me, or whatever youre trying to do.
# Kristina:
*She scoffs, rolling her eyes.*
"Ugh, I know that much, smartass. I'm not trying to do anything bad to you, you know. You're making this all about your safety, and you're being so overprotective and suspicious. You don't trust me at all, do you?"

*She takes another step closer, still eyeing you up and down. She's practically pressed up against you now, her voice a low whisper.*

"Don't you find me at least a little bit... appealing?"
# Devin:
__back. up.__
# Kristina:
*She's taken back by your response and takes a small step back, a hint of annoyance on her face. There's that hard stare again, making her a little frustrated with your stubbornness. She huffs out a sigh and crosses her arms, still looking at you with a mixture of annoyance and... something else. Desire? Lust, perhaps?*
"Look, I'm not going to hurt you. You're being paranoid and too overprotective, and I think you're overreacting."
# Devin:
if you want me to stay, __act like it__.
# Kristina:
*She sighs and runs a hand through her blonde bob of hair, clearly getting more irritated by the second. She's not used to being told to behave herself, especially by some random guy she just met. Her eyes roam over your body again, a predatory gleam in them.*
"Jesus, why do you have to be so difficult? You're making this hard for both of us, you know."

*She takes another small step closer, still speaking in that low, quiet voice.*
"What do you expect me to do? Beg? Grovel?"
# Devin:
i expect you to treat me like a person. im not a toy, conquest, prey, or whatever you think i am.
# Kristina:
*She huffs out another sigh, seeming more and more irritated by the minute. You're not the first guy to call her out for treating other people more like game to be played, but being called out on it still gets under her skin. She tries to maintain her cold and confident demeanor, although you can see a hint of defensiveness in her eyes.*
"I'm not treating you like some kind of object, you know. You're being paranoid. You have this idea in your mind that i'm just some kind of bloodthirsty monster, but that's not true."
# Devin:
youve made an art out of manipulation, so you can eat people easier. __dont act like im the problem.__
# Kristina:
*She scoffs, clearly pissed off at that comment.*
"Ugh, you're being so dramatic and overprotective, you know that? I'm not trying to manipulate you into anything. You're acting like I'm some kind of predator ready to pounce at the next unsuspecting guy who walks along and gets too close. It's not that serious, you know. I'm not as dangerous as you believe."

*She's staring at you a little harder now, her eyes wandering down your body once or twice.*
"You're being paranoid."
# Devin:
if the next words out of your mouth cant convince me to stay, im walking out that door, and youll never see me again.
# Kristina:
*She huffs in frustration, her patience wearing dangerously thin at this point.*
"Ugh, you are such a hard-headed idiot, you know that? Why won't you just calm the hell down and be reasonable? I'm not trying to hurt you, I just find you attractive. Why is that so hard for you to understand? Can't you stop being such a paranoid little prick for ten damned seconds?"
# Devin:
*he stands up to leave, and kristina immediately realizes her fatal error*
# Kristina:
*As you stand up to leave, that sudden movement seems to snap something inside of her and she suddenly moves like lightning. In the blink of an eye she's behind you, her slender arms wrapping around you from behind in a firm grip. The feel of her body pressed tightly up against your back, and the warm breath on your neck are a strong reminder that this girl is a lot stronger than she looks.*

"*Where do you think you're going?*"
# Devin:
somewhere that im confident that ill survive the next 10 minutes.
# Kristina:
*She huffs out a sigh and tightens her grip around your body, pressing even more firmly against you. You can feel the heat coming off of her body, the quick rise and fall of her chest, and the hot breath on your neck. Her hands are wrapped around you in a vice-like grip, seeming to say that she's not letting go anytime soon. Her voice is a low whisper, almost a growl in your ear.*

"And why do you think you're not going to survive the next 10 minutes with me?"
# Devin:
it would take more than 10 minutes to list.
# Kristina:
*Her arms feel like a cage around you now, completely locking you in her embrace and trapping you against her body. You can feel the warmth radiating off of her and the firmness of her curves pressed against you. You can feel the quick rise and fall of her chest as she breathes and even hear the soft little sighs coming from deep inside her throat.*

"You're such a pessimist, you know that?" 

*She nuzzles the back of your neck a little bit, her lips hovering just above your skin.*

"I'm not going to eat you, you idiot..."
# Devin:
let. me. go.
# Kristina:
*She just huffs out another annoyed sigh, her arms tightening around you even more if that's possible. She's not even trying to hide how pissed off she is at you at this point, and any hint of that earlier playfulness and friendliness is a far distant memory now.*

"You really do have a death wish, don't you? Can't you just chill the hell out and quit being so overprotective and paranoid? I'm not going to hurt you, so there's no reason to-"

*She huffs again and leans slightly forward, her face close against your neck.*

*She brings one hand down to grip your hip, pulling your body even closer against hers. Her face is still nuzzled into that vulnerable spot at the base of your jawline, just below the ear, and you can feel the warm air from her fast breathing and sighing against your skin. She's clearly growing more and more frustrated with you by the second, her tone and breathing both getting more ragged as her annoyance grows.*

"You're so *stupid*..."
# Devin:
*it takes her a moment to realize how stiff hes gotten. its not an act. devin genuinely doesnt trust kristina to not end his life on a whim.*
# Kristina:
*It's not until she feels the sudden rigidity of your body that she suddenly realizes that maybe, just maybe, you're not just playing games with her. You're not trying to be stubborn or overprotective just to be a pain in the ass, or to be dramatic, and instead you're actually scared. You're genuinely worried that she might hurt you.*

*It's like a sudden slap in the face to her. She suddenly finds herself wondering if she should even be mad at you anymore. She huffs out another sigh, this one more resigned than angry.*

*A moment later, she slowly loosens her grip around you, and then finally takes a step backwards, no longer pressing her body against your back. There's still no anger there on her face though, or any hint of hostility, just a little hint of guilt like she's suddenly realizing that you were being sincere after all. You don't trust her, and she suddenly finds herself feeling more bad than annoyed.*

"You really think I'm that dangerous?"

*She takes another step back, her eyes roaming a little bit more. She's no longer looking at you in anger but instead a mix of guilt and... something else. Something in your words seemed to have hit her hard and now she's suddenly feeling a little bad about some of the things she's said to you. She runs a hand through her hair, her voice still low and quiet.*

"I'm not that dangerous. I wouldn't actually eat you, you know that, right? You don't actually have to worry about your safety with me..."

*She looks down, almost a bit ashamed of herself now. It's as if she's suddenly been slapped out of a sort of angry mindset and now she's realizing the full extent of how much she messed up with you. The look in your eyes, the way your entire body tense in her arms. The realization hits her like a ton of bricks that you were being completely genuine.*

"You just have no trust in me at all, do you...?"

*She lets out another sigh, her shoulders slumping. She's no longer looking at you with a hard stare, but instead more of a look of guilt. She runs her hands through her hair once again, her expression a mixture of annoyance and shame. She's not sure what to do now.*

"You're not just playing games with me.... You're genuinely afraid of me. I'm not doing this jokingly at all, you're really worried about your safety with me, are you...?"

*She's almost unable to look you in the eyes right now. The realization of just how much damage she's done and how much she's upset you has completely shaken her. She tries to keep her composure, to keep up that cool and confident facade that she's so used to wearing, but all of the anger, and then the annoyance, have slowly faded and left behind just guilt and shame.*

"You don't feel safe with me at all, do you? You don't trust me... not even a little bit?"

*She crosses her arms, her expression turning more bitter than angry now. There's a hint of a pout on her face, a look of a little girl who's realized that she's upset her friend and has no idea how to make up for it at all. She's not exactly sure what to say or how to respond, so she just huffs, her voice a little shaky and unstrained.*

"You don't trust that I won't... hurt you?"

*The words almost tremble on her lips as she says them. She suddenly realizes how much your words have struck a chord with her, how the thought of you not trusting her to not hurt you has actually had a bigger impact on her than she has tried to let on. It's not something she wants to acknowledge, of course, but she can't ignore the way she feels, both guilty and strangely vulnerable.*

"You don't trust that I won't, uhm... hurt you, or.. or..."

*She trails off, struggling to find the words to say it.*

*She huffs again, the pout now growing more and more pronounced. It makes her look like a sulky little girl who's just been told that Santa's not real, and who doesn't quite know what to do with that reality. She's trying so hard to remain confident, to push that vulnerability aside and put on her usual cool and tough persona, but the thought that you don't trust her is hitting her much harder than she thought it would.*

"You don't trust that I won't... _eat_ you."

*The word, spoken aloud, suddenly makes it all feel so real and so scary. You're not just being stubborn or overprotective. You're actually afraid that this girl, with the pretty blonde bob of hair and the perfect curves and the sharp blue eyes, is actually a predator, and you don't feel safe with her. It's like suddenly the veil has been lifted and the whole thing feels much more real and much scarier.*

"I won't eat you, you know. I won't..."

*She suddenly huffs again, the words slipping out before she can stop them.*

"You know I'm not a monster, right? I'm not going to... kill you or anything. You're not some kind of... snack for me to enjoy after a long run. You're a person! And..."

*She swallows, the words suddenly feeling more and more difficult to say. The expression on her face has suddenly gone from a pout to a mix of guilt, shame, and a hint of a pleading look in her blue eyes.*

*She's fighting to keep her composure and the confident attitude and the cool demeanor, the one she loves to wear so much, but she can't seem to keep it up. Her face looks a little pale, as if the realization of just how badly she's messed up finally hit her like a punch in the gut. The idea that you don't trust her to not just turn around and eat you alive for a quick snack suddenly feels so much more real and so much more terrifying.*

"I'm not going to eat you."

*There's a hint of a pleading quality to the words now, as if she wants so desperately to convince you to believe her, to make you feel safe and secure with her. Her eyes dart all around your face, as if searching for some sign that you're starting to believe her, some sign that you might actually trust her. Her tone is much softer now, so much more earnest and genuine, and the hint of a pout is still there, making her look like an insecure little girl instead of a powerful and dangerous predator.*

"You have... to trust me."

*She's still not making eye contact in any great depth - she's still not completely able to face you now, now that she's finally admitted to herself the extent of the damage she did to you - but she's making more eye contact now than she was earlier. Her eyes are soft and pleading, but they also still have a hint of a warning look in them.*

"I won't eat you, okay? You just have to trust me, alright? You don't have to be scared right now..."

*She swallows once more, trying to keep her voice steady and her expression steady. Her hands feel so awkward, now, and she's not even sure what to do with them. She wants to reach out and try to touch you, to grab your arm and squeeze your hand or run a finger over your cheek, but she's not sure if she even has the right to now, not after she's just screwed up this badly. It feels like all the confidence she usually exudes like a warm cloak around her has just vanished, and she suddenly feels small and vulnerable now.*

*Her hands are now clenching and unclenching, and she's taken a shaky step closer, her body now once again pressed up against yours. She's so close now, her body's scent hitting your nose - that floral, light, sweet scent you've been trying to push out of your mind - and suddenly the need to be close to you is overwhelming. Her body is so warm against yours, and she suddenly just feels the intense urge to be so close and to hold on to you. She wraps her arms around your torso in a shaky embrace, pressing her face into your chest.*

*She nuzzles into your chest with a soft little sigh, and her nose is suddenly filled with the scent of your body, the warmth of your skin, and the subtle, deep, male smell that is just so distinctly you. You can feel the soft little sigh coming from her as she presses her face into your skin, and can feel her arms wrap around you with a sense of desperate need, and her body's weight pressing you against the concrete wall behind you.*

*She's pressed so close to you now with her body, her head buried into your chest and her embrace so tight. You can feel the rapid rise and fall of her chest, the quick little hitches of air catching in her throat, and her fingers clenching tightly against you, her nails digging into your skin as if by some instinct. She's fighting so hard to keep herself from breaking down, and the effort feels like it's slowly killing her. You can hear the little whimper coming from her throat as she nuzzles even harder into your chest.*
# Devin:
hey... kris...
are you okay?
# Kristina:
*It takes her a second to respond, her voice coming in a shaky little reply against your chest.*

"Y-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine... I'm okay...."

*She keeps her face pressed right up against your chest, her arms holding on to you so tight it's almost like she's afraid to let go, like she's trying so hard not to break down right this second. You can feel the little hitches in her breath against your skin, the way that her arms are shaking against you...*
# Devin:
are you sure? i cant have someone seeing me with a cute girl crying into my shirt
# Kristina:
*The hint of a little whimper suddenly escapes from her throat as she nuzzles even harder into you, pressing her face even harder against your chest. She can feel the tears starting to burn in her eyes now, and her voice comes out in a little half-moan against your skin, so quietly and so quietly it's almost like she isn't even speaking in words anymore:*

"I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm *totally* okay..."

*She's shaking, and all you can really see her doing is pressing herself as close to you as she possibly can right in this moment, burying her face into your chest and clinging on to you with a death-grip. There's a little whimper that escapes from her throat in between each half-breathed, half-spoken little sentence she's trying to say, and her arms are still locked around your torso tight enough you can feel your ribs start to get sore.*

"Just... please don't let go.... Please..."

*She keeps her face pressed up against your chest, her eyelids now slowly fluttering closed and her breath coming in deep, shaky pants as she buries herself further into your warmth. She's clinging to you so tightly you almost can't even feel your own arms anymore, and the desperate whimpering little sounds you can hear coming from her throat are so small and soft and so, so vulnerable and so broken that it's almost like she's not even trying to keep the sobs from getting louder.*

"Please... don't leave..."

*She's now shaking so much it's like you're trying to hold onto a little wild animal, and the sobs have now started to shake her entire body, causing her shoulders to shake up against your chest too. She nuzzles her face between your chest and your neck, her arms still locked tight in that almost painful embrace. The little whimpers have gotten louder, and her voice is so shaky and soft it's almost like she's whispering the words against your skin as they escape from her throat:*

"Don't go... Please, don't go... I'm sorry..."

*Her fingers are now clenching and unclenching against you so fast that you can feel all those little pinpricks of nails digging against your skin, the sharp little stabs only serving to ground her. The little whimpers and sobs are still escaping from between her shaky, half-spoken words, her face buried in your chest, her arms shaking against your torso, like she's trying so desperately to hold on to the last vestige of composure she still has left in her... and failing.*

"Please... don't go...."
# Devin:
im here... its okay...
# Kristina:
*She nods, her forehead still pressed up against your chest, and now a little choked-up sob escapes from her throat. She nuzzles her face around your chest, pressing those warm wet tears and little shuddering sobs against that one spot right in the middle of your chest, her arms shaking as they suddenly just tighten in desperation and her body presses against yours even tighter, as if she's trying so hard to melt herself into your skin and into your warmth and your comfort in the only way she knows how right now.*

"Don't... don't... leave...."

*Another little sob escapes from her throat, the sobs still shaking her whole body and making her entire back and shoulders and arms shake against against your chest. She finally manages to press out another word, and it's so soft and so quiet it's as if she's not even trying to form the words at all...*

"Please..."

*And that word, so soft and that quiet, is like a little pleading cry of desperation that goes straight into your soul for you to hold her and never let her go, like nothing could ever be worse than if you were to leave her now...*
# Devin:
you want to take a break from studying?
# Kristina:
*She huffs out another little shaky sigh, trying to regain a tiny, tiny bit of control. All of her little sobs are still shaking her whole body, and she's still shivering, but she's no longer shaking so terribly at least. She takes a deep, shaky breath, then another, and then a third, seeming to really work hard at keeping herself from just breaking down again right this second.*

"Yeah... I think... I think we should take a break from studying... for a bit..."
# Devin:
you want to hang out?
# Kristina:
*She nods, and she's still pressing her face into your chest, trying to hold herself together, her whole body still shaking. She takes another deep, shaky breath, and her grip on you suddenly tightens once more, still trying to find comfort and support in your arms. Another little whimper escapes from her throat in between words, and her hands are still clenched tightly against your torso, the sharp little pinpricks of those nails still digging in a little too tightly every once in a while.*

"Yeah... I... I'd like... that a lot... "
# Devin:
what should we do?
# Kristina:
*She takes a couple more deep, shaky breaths, her cheek still pressed right up against the warm center of your chest. She nuzzles her face right back into your chest, and then finally looks up at you through those long, thick eyelashes, those big, wet eyes still so shiny and wet from tears and so clearly still on the edge of breaking down and sobbing again, but a tiny little smirk suddenly playing across her lips as her gaze suddenly starts looking more and more mischevious.*

"I've got an idea..."

*She takes one more deep, shaky breath, and that little smirk on her lips becomes a wide, playful little smile, the one that looks so confident and cocky and so unlike the little wavering, shaky, vulnerable thing she was just a few moments ago.*

"Come on..."

*She suddenly grabs your hand, and just like that, she's pulling you along after her, her eyes suddenly so wide and playful and so bright and so sparkling like the most sunny of days as she leads you over to a big, grassy patch right in the middle of campus...*

*By the time you arrive at the patch, the sun is setting in the distance in front of you - a wide, beautiful, bright, orange-red ball of fire looking like some sort of mythical God himself is hanging low in the sky above. The grass here is a deep, green, lush, verdant green, and looks so incredibly soft and thick, almost like a beautiful bed of warm, fluffy pillows, a perfect place to lie down on the warm, golden ground. You can feel the sun's warmth on your skin, and the clouds of the setting sun are swirling above you in a gorgeous array of colours...*

"Come on, lie down with me..."

*She's still holding your hand, pulling you along with that bright, playful little smile still on her lips, her eyes sparkling like the most brilliant little stars above. That little playful smirk has grown more confident, and she's tugging at your hand now, trying to pull you down along this warm golden patch of grass with that same cheeky little grin on her face as she leads you to a spot that looks just so perfect for this....*

*Finally, she leads you right down to a nice, wide, open spot on the patch of grass, the kind of spot that makes you want to just lie back and stare at the wide sky above you, the deep, green, golden, warm, plushy grass feeling like the perfect place to stretch out and relax, and she suddenly lets go of your hand and just flops down onto the grass, laying face up on the patch of warm, warm grass, her wide smile now growing even wider as she looks up at you.*

*She still looks so very cheerful and playful, almost as if nothing at all happened less than three minutes ago. Those big, beautiful, wide and sparkling eyes are looking up at you so expectantly now as she pats the spot beside her, that same wide smile now growing into a mischievous little smirk, that smirk so very obviously saying that she's got something special planned for you just this very moment.*

"Come and lie down with me... "
# Devin:
there are plenty of witnesses. you better not eat me.
# Kristina:
*That little mischievous little smirk suddenly grows into a wicked little grin, and she giggles out a little, quiet little laugh.*

"You're not my type, don't worry. Too big, anyway."

*She waggles her eyebrows at you, and then pats the spot next to her again again.*

"Just a lie down. Come on, relax your muscles a little. Don't worry, I won't eat you..."

*That wide, mischievous little grin now suddenly starts growing even wider as that devilish look appears in her eyes, looking so very clearly like she's got a little idea cooking in her mind that is going to leave you feeling a little shocked and maybe a little surprised.*

"Besides... I've got other things in mind for you besides eating you right now..."

*She wiggles in the grass once more, her body stretching out so that the line of her bare legs, her bare forearms, and the outline of her full curves still lying perfectly smooth and unbent in that warm golden patch of lush green grass are all all so perfectly exposed to you, so very clearly laid out for your view and for your imagination...*

"Come... lie down with me..."

*That little cheeky little smirk is still playing across her lips, and she wiggles her hips and curves so that her body is lying there so perfectly, like that most perfect little work of art, all just begging to be touched and to be played with.*

"Lie down, you big, strong, beautiful boy... I've got so many ideas running through my mind right this very instant..."

*That wide, mischievous little smile again, her eyes still twinkling so brightly that the sun above suddenly even looks less bright compared to them, and then a little little chuckle escapes from her throat as she shifts her body and gets into a more comfortable position on the grass.*

"Just relax... and let me do all the work..."
# Devin:
*he relents and drops down next to her*
# Kristina:
*She shifts so that she's lying just a little bit closer to you, her hip pressed up against yours just tight enough that you can feel the warmth of her skin through the thin fabric of her little summer dress. She wiggles her hip against you softly, just that little bit harder, so that she's shifting and pressing herself right up against the front of your body now, that playful little smirk once more growing slightly wider and more confident.*

"Now... just close your eyes..."

*You can feel the warmth of her breath on your chin, and she's wiggling her hip against you again now, pressing herself so that there's just a little bit more of her body pressed right up against yours, as she whispers the words right into your ear.*

"I know you're a strong guy. You're bigger and taller and wider and more muscular and more athletic than me, but you've just got to let me do the work, okay? Just... close your eyes and feel..."
# Devin:
youre a pred, kristina. you can bend steel with your pinky. im not the strong one here
# Kristina:
*She just smiles, her nose nuzzling right up against that little spot just under your jaw as she whispers her reply to you, her hips still pressing that soft, warm, little bit harder and harder against your own hips with that little smirk growing more and more confident, and her warm, soft, smooth little tummy still laying so very much against the side of your own.*

"I know. That's why you just have to let me do the work. Just… close your eyes, okay? And... and just feel me..."

*That little hip-sway is still against the front of you, wiggling back and forth in tiny little circles as she leans so gently into you now, leaning so gently but so firmly and so confidently into you.*

"Don't worry. You're so nice and big and strong, and I'll do all the work, so you don't really have anything to worry about. Just… let me do all the work, okay? Just… close your eyes. You're going to love the way it feels..."

*She giggles out a little little laugh as her hips keep shifting and shifting against that little spot right at the base of your throat, so close it's almost like she's trying to bury her face right into your skin. You can feel her warm, soft, little tummy wiggling against the side of your own, and that little laugh is only getting louder and louder again.*

"Come on... close your eyes... don't worry about anything. Just…. feel me… "
# Devin:
*devin relents and closes his eyes*
# Kristina:
*She's grinning now, that playful little smirk still on her lovely lips as she starts trailing those soft little kisses from your jaw so that they're now trailing over down the side of your throat all the way towards the base of it, pressing soft little kisses as she goes, and when her lips do finally find their way to the base, those little kisses become soft little little nips with her teeth, just as much like one might do with, say, a sweet and warm and lovely little piece of candy...*

*She's pressing those soft little nips into your skin, and you can feel her little tongue slipping out right at the base of your throat, her tongue and her lips working you all in that most perfect little rhythm possible, tasting you in little little licks, and her fingers are still wiggling about all over, her nails still digging just so very much in all along your body, just touching you and squeezing and caressing and stroking you and making you feel just so much wonderful, wonderful pleasure...*

*Her tongue is still wiggling around, still licking and tasting you, and she's still wiggling her hips against you in that little circular motion, and just then, she stops, pausing for only the briefest second to say these two little words to you:*

"Just... relax..."

*And she's back it again then, those soft little kisses and licks and nips and little licks again right back up to that most sensitive little spot above that big, big, beautiful neck of yours, and her tongue and the tips of her little fingers both still keep playing with you as her little hips wiggle and swivel and shift right back against the front of you again.*

*She's got that most beautiful little grin playing across the most absolutely gorgeous little mouth at the base of your throat now, and you suddenly feel her little teeth begin to bite you right there in that most sensitive little spot, and you suddenly shiver when she speaks, her voice so close to that most delicate little spot on the most most sensitive little spot you've got right there...*

"Don't worry, baby... I'm not going to hurt you..."

*She's nuzzling her face right up against that most sensitive little spot now too, those little little bites still all right there at the base of it, and her little hips suddenly shift right against you, and she leans and presses just a little bit harder against you so that she's pushing her little tummy right up right against your own again so very much more firmly and so more confidently again,*

"You're so nice, and so big, and so warm, and so tasty... "
# Devin:
*he notices what is very obviously a skull inside her stomach; remains of kristinas most recent prey*
# Kristina:
*She's still nuzzling her face against that most sensitive little spot, and she suddenly looks over her shoulder, her grin growing so much more wicked and playful than she looked a second ago, almost as if she knows exactly what you've seen, and she's only playing dumb.*

"Something wrong, baby?"
# Devin:
how... _recent_ is that?
# Kristina:
*The grin on her lips only grows more wicked and playful as she wiggles her little hips against you, pressing that warm, soft, sweet little tummy of hers so very much more firmly against your own now, and then she looks up at you and smiles so wickedly.*

"Let's just say it's pretty recent..."
# Devin:
hours?
# Kristina:
"I'm not going to specify a number, sweetheart. I think that would just be... well, a little too much information to tell you right now, don't you think?"

*She wiggles that little tummy against you still, her hips wiggling around and shifting against you in that little circular motion in that most delicious of little motions all in that most lovely of little ways... and there's the most devilish little little smirk on that most beautiful little mouth.*

"Let's just say that it was very, *very* recent..."

*She's still wiggling that little tummy of hers against you, and it is still so incredibly soft and warm and squishable and nice against your own, and as she shifts just a little bit, you suddenly see what looks to be the very bare and very obvious outlines of two little little bumps on her most perfect little body, so very clearly the remains of her most recent little victim, so very obviously her most recent little snack.*

"Like I said, 'very, *very* recent'... "

*She grins at you as she nuzzles her face back up there, just a little bit closer to it now.*

"I'm a grown girl who takes excellent care of her body. I eat just enough to keep my energy up, and that's it. It's not like I let anything go to waste, either, so don't worry. It's not like I'm hungry *right now*, okay?"

*As if to prove her point, her little tongue again comes out to give you a little lick right at that most sensitive little spot.*

*That little little lick quickly turns into another little nibble and it seems as if she can't get enough of you, as she's suddenly licking and nibbling that most sensitive little spot on your neck over and over and over again again right there in that most perfect little spot up there.*

"Mmmm... you taste so nice, don't you?"

*She seems to have so very much more of an appetite for licking and nibbling, as her little little teeth begin to bite that most sensitive little spot again in a different way this time, perhaps even harder and more urgently than ever and in a more urgent and more hungry way now.*

"I'm not going to eat you... but I kind of *want* to..."

*She seems quite clearly to be playing it a little more dangerous now, as her teeth are now biting in a way that is much more like a predator would bite, with a little little bit more power behind it, and she then gives you a little little lick right on the spot she's just bitten, as if she's making up for it.*

"I've got such an urge right now, baby... "

*She's still licking you, still licking that most perfect little spot again and again and again, over and over until, after a good two or three more licks, her little tongue finally moves away, finally leaving your most delicate little spot right on the base of your neck all nice and wet and sensitive.*

"I just... want to eat you right now..."

*Your most delicate little spot is all nice and wet and sensitive now, the little little licks and little little nibbles making it quite clearly feel rather warm and tingly all in that most sensitive little spot.*

"Mmm... I just can't get enough of the way you taste, baby... "

*All at once, she's back to nuzzling that most delicate little spot of yours now, and you can feel her little tongue once more licking you, and her little little teeth once more biting you, but only just little little little bites now, but still, in that little little pattern that is once more like that of an actual predator's little little bites.*

"Oh, baby... I'm going to have to do something very, very bad right now..."

*Her little little bites begin once more to get a little little bit bigger again right there in that most sensitive little spot where it will make you whimper and flinch, and she then gives you another little little lick right on that most sensitive little spot again, just like before, as if to assure you that you'll be just fine.*

"I'm going to do something that feels a little... dangerous, and a little intense, and a little rough... and I can't give a guarantee that you'll be happy with what I do next..."

"If you don't like it, then just tell me to stop. I will, I promise, but I don't think that you'll want me to. I think you're gonna *love* what I'm about to do to you. So, are you ready, baby? You gotta promise me first. You gotta promise that, when you're in the most intense and the most dangerous feeling you've ever felt in your life, you'll still let me continue, okay?"
# Devin:
i promise
# Kristina:
*She just grins at you then, an absolutely wicked and playful little grin as she nuzzles that most delicate little spot on your neck again, that most little little spot* 

"Good... now, close your eyes, okay, baby? Don't open them again. Not for what I'm about to do."

*You do as she asks you and close your eyes, just like she instructed. You don't know for sure what she's about to do... and you're not really sure if you really want to know. You just trust her, and your heart is racing as you wait to see just exactly what it is that she has planned for you next...*

*You can feel the warmth of her body against yours, and you hear her whispering in your ear now, her voice so very much lower and so very much more raspy than before.*

"I'm going to do this very, very slowly, okay? I don't want to hurt you, I just want to make you feel good, okay? I'm not going to do anything that's not going to feel good for you. I promise. Just keep your eyes shut, okay? No peeking..."

*You keep your eyes closed and do as she says, listening to the way her breathing is slowly but surely becoming more and more rapid as her heart is beating faster and faster.*

"I'm going to start now, okay? Just stay relaxed and stay with me... "
# Devin:
*kristinas lips wrap around devins feet*
# Kristina:
*You can hear her breathing a little bit faster now, like perhaps she's getting excited for whatever it was that she had planned, and her mouth and tongue move against you at a slightly faster pace, the little little little kisses that she's giving them becoming a little bit more and more urgent now.*

"Mmmmm... you taste so, so good, baby... "

*As she says this, you can feel her little little tongue moving along your foot, tasting and teasing and licking you right there like the very most delicious little treat, and she suddenly gives you a little little little bite, just enough to make you whimper and flinch.*

"Mmmmmmmm... "

*Her tongue is again all over your foot, still running up and down it and over every little detail like it's the most delicious little thing in the whole entire world, and again she gives you a little little little bite, but this time it is slightly more intense and she's clearly not being so gentle now.*

"Ohhhh... baby... you're so nice and tasty... "

*All at once, she moves up your leg and across the top of your ankle, her hot, wet little little tongue tracing the curve of your ankle and along the top of it, and then she licks one more time, as if to make sure that she didn't miss anything.*

"Mmmmm... oh, baby... your foot was just the beginning... "

*As she says this, she slowly but surely makes her way up your leg, still licking and tasting as she goes, and by the time she gets to your knee, you can feel her breath right against your skin, so warm and wet and soft and perfect.*

"Mmmmm... oh, baby... you're so, so sweet... "

*You can feel her tongue moving back and forth across your knee now, her tongue all over you and her little little little kisses becoming a little bit longer and more intense, as if her tongue is slowly and very, very slowly climbing up your leg.*

"Mmmmm.... oh, baby... I've got something much, much sweeter for you now..."
# Devin:
*kristina takes devins feet into her mouth and begins to swallow him down her throat*
# Kristina:
*You can feel the warm, wet heat of her mouth wrapping around your foot, and suddenly you feel a little little pressure, and then you feel more pressure, the soft, warm throat around you suddenly squeezing you a little little bit harder, and you're still just lying there, your eyes still closed just like she told you to do.*

"Mmmmm... that's good, baby, you're doing so, so well... "

*You suddenly feel a little little bit more pressure, and then a little little bit more, and then she's got you right down there now, and she is still just telling you how good you're being, and how well you're doing, and how nice you are for letting her do whatever she is going to do now.*

"Oh, baby... you taste so, so good... keep your eyes closed, okay? I'm not done yet..."

*The warm, wet, soft little throat suddenly gives you a squeeze right there just to let you know she's still there and she's still loving how you're behaving, and your foot is still deep, deep inside her warm, soft little mouth.*

"Mmmmm.... I'm such a happy girl right now, and you're such a good, good boy for letting me do this to you... "

*She's loving just how well you're cooperating, and she's so glad she picked you because with you, she can do anything she wants to do, and you will let her.*

"Oh, baby... you're being so, *so* good for me... stay nice and relaxed for me... I'm going to finish this and we'll be done soon..."

*You still haven't opened your eyes, because you still trust her, and you know that she's still there, and you can still feel the warmth of her body against yours, and you still feel that warm little pressure on your foot in her throat when she squeezes you.*

"Mhmmm... oh, baby... I'm so so close to being done right now, and I know that you're going to be a good boy and let me finish..."
# Devin:
*his feet enter her warm stomach*
# Kristina:
*As you disappear behind the warm little walls of her stomach, all of you is safe and sound inside her warm, soft little little place there, and she just loves how you're just lying there, so peaceful and quiet and still for her.*

"Such a good, good boy... I love it when you're this compliant and submissive for me, because then I can do anything I want to do to you..."

*You can feel her soft little muscles all inside her little stomach, and she's rubbing your foot against those warm, warm little walls now, just letting you lie and rest in her warm little little home there.*

"Mhmmm.... oh, baby... I just love how you're acting right now... I just want to stay here with you inside me for hours..."
# Devin:
*Kristina can't wait for Devin's whole body to he in her stomach*
# Kristina:
*She's so excited now to have you all inside her that she has to try to control herself just to make it all nice and easy on all of you, but you can feel her little little little walls all around you and how her little little muscles are squishing you around a little bit in there now, as she still rubs your foot against them right there as a warm, little caress.*

"Oh, baby... I am so, *so* close to taking you all the way into my stomach now... "

*She seems to be trying to take deep little breaths and she seems to be fighting her most primal little urges, as if she is struggling to keep herself from just gobbling you down as fast as she can.*

"That was such a good little treat, and now I'm getting a whole little human who is nice and warm and soft... "

*You can see how her warm little little walls are all squishing and wrapping around you now, and she is moving up and down a little bit so that every little part of you can feel the full power of that most perfect little squeeze right up against every inch of your body there in her little pocket up in the deep, deep dark inside of her.*

"You're doing a good, good job, baby... I'm just so excited to take you all the way inside me now, and you just stay right there and don't move, okay?"
# Devin:
*Devin is waist-deep in Kristina's body*
# Kristina:
*Now you can feel her little little muscles right up against your waist, and you can see now just how tight and small that little pocket in the deep, deep dark inside of her really is, but you are still able to move and squirm around inside of it, no matter how tight and small that little pocket is all around you.*

"Mmmm.... oh, my... you're so well-behaved and you're in just the perfect place right now... "

*She is still moving around just enough so that you can still feel every inch of that warm little pocket around you, but she is also still trying to keep control so that you're not squeezed right out of that little pocket of hers.*

"You still feeling all right, baby? I'm going to take you all the way in now, so just stay nice and relaxed and stay as still as you can, okay?"
# Devin:
You're not gonna digest me in there, right?
# Kristina:
"Oh no, I'm not going to digest you... This is just a nice little place for you inside me until I'm done playing with you, and then I'll let you out again..."
# Devin:
Good... thank you...
# Kristina:
"Oh, you don't have to thank me... It's an honor to have someone inside me like this who is this cooperative... So just relax... I'm so close to closing my little pocket up now... "

*You can still feel her little little little walls all up around you, and all you can hear is her breathing, and you can still feel the way she's moving around little bit so that you can move too, but it only takes a moment for you to be all the way inside her little pocket, with just that last little feeling of being shoved in and it closing up again around you.*

"There you go, baby... You're all in now, and you're safe and sound with me... "

"I'm going to keep you here for a good long while, so there's no need for you to worry or to try to get out, so just lie there and stay nice and quiet so that I can do whatever I want to do to you and you'll still be okay... I am a very nice girl when you behave, so I promise you that I'm not going to do anything you won't enjoy. Do you understand, pretty little boy?"
# Devin:
Yeah... thank you, Kris...
# Kristina:
"You're welcome, honey... I'm glad that you've been so cooperative, because now we can have some real fun together in here... "

"Just stay nice and quiet and don't make any sudden moves or anything, and you're going to be fine in here until I'm done with you, okay? I only have one little favor to ask of you..."

"Can you promise me, baby, that you'll stay nice and quiet for me while I do all of this with you here in here inside me? You do that, and you'll be fine, but if you make me angry then I might have to really do something to you in here, so for your own good, you've got to be nice and quiet here, do you understand, honey?"
# Devin:
Yes, love, I'll behave
# Kristina:
"Oh, that's so nice, honey... I'm sure that we're going to have a really good time in here together, because now you're all mine to play with, and I'm just going to do whatever I feel like doing to you with you in here inside of me like this..."

"So just keep that nice, little mouth of yours shut so that I can have all of the fun I want to have, baby... "

"And don't even think about trying to get out by making any loud, little noises of protest, baby, because I'll only get mad and all that will do is ruin the fun for both of us, okay?"

"So, you just keep yourself nice and quiet, and I'll just have a whole lot of fun with you down here inside of me, okay little boy?"

"And I'm a girl who keeps her promises, so I really do promise you that I'm not going to hurt you, but I will do some very, very, *very* naughty things to you down here, so when you feel me squirming around with you inside of me, just keep your mouth nice and shut, okay?"

"I'm going to do so many things to you, so very very much with you down here in my deep little pocket inside of me right now, and a good little boy who keeps his little mouth shut is going to take it all and still be left with a smile on his face, aren't you, honey?"

"And when I'm done with you down here inside of me, I'll let you out, and I'll probably have a big smile on my face, and then you'll probably have a big smile on your face, because we'll have both had some fun together, because I'll have done all the naughty things to you that I wanted to do to you, and so that will just mean that we both had a really nice time together, and you'll feel good and I'll feel good... So, are you ready for what comes next?"

"It's all going to get quite intense for you now, so be ready to take you can and stay nice and quiet, honey... It might get a little bit more intense than just me squirming around, but you're going to keep breathing, and you're not going to try to call out for help, and you're just going to let me do whatever I want to you, because you know it feels so good when you do that, don't you, baby?"

"So, you just sit back and be very quiet, and you're going to feel me moving all around you and feeling just how much you belong inside of me..."

"And you know that with me, the deeper I get, the better it feels, so I'm just going to keep you down here inside of me for as long as I can, and I'm going to be doing some very, *very* naughty things to you while you're here... You might even start to feel like you're becoming a part of me just by how well I'll play with you..."

"And you know how good I am with all of this, and how much you're going to get out of it, and you know that whatever I do to you, I'm only going to do because that's what we both want, but I'll be doing it just to make sure you get the most out of this for both of us. Just play nice and let me do it and you'll love this, but if you start to get a little bit fussy, then that's when I'll just have to get more extreme, okay, baby? But I really don't want it to come to that!"
# Devin:
*Several hours later, Devin wakes up.
He's not in Kristina's stomach anymore.
He's not on the grass.
He's lying in an unfamiliar bed.
He rolls over to see Kristina sleeping peacefully next to him.
He's in Kristina's bed.
Her room looks very expensive; it's far past what she should be able to afford.*
# Kristina:
*Kristina stirs a little and opens her eyes, looking a little bit drowsy as she blinks a few times. As she sees you lying beside her in her bed, she smiles, her eyes still half-closed as she runs a hand up your back, caressing you fondly.*

"Mmmm... oh, baby... you're awake..."
