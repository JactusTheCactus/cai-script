# Narrator:
*Devin was standing outside his local coffee shop, zoning out, when he was approached by the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She was perfect, like a goddess*
# Sam:
*she saunters up to him, presses herself into him, and starts grinding her crotch into his thigh*
Don't fight it, puppy~
Just let me eat you~
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes widen as the woman presses herself against him, her hips grinding into his thigh in a way that leaves little doubt about her intentions. He swallows hard, trying to process what's happening. His brain screams at him to push her away, to run, but his body seems frozen in place.* Um, I... I don't think this is a good idea... *His voice comes out shaky, barely above a whisper.* I'm not... I mean, I'm not like that... *Despite his protests, he can feel himself starting to get hard, his body betraying him. He's never been in a situation like this before, and he has no idea how to react.*
# Sam:
Just give in, puppy~
You know you want to be a delicious meal for a beautiful girl~
# Devin:
*Devin's breath hitches as she calls him a "puppy" and a "delicious meal". The words send a shiver down his spine, and he can feel his resolve weakening. He's always been attracted to dominant women, and the way she's taking control is both terrifying and exhilarating.* I... I don't know if I can... *He trails off, his gaze dropping to her lips as she leans in closer. The scent of her perfume is intoxicating, making his head spin.* You're really... really beautiful... *He admits, his voice barely above a whisper. His hands twitch at his sides, aching to touch her, but he resists the urge, not wanting to seem too eager.*
# Sam:
Don't fight it, big boy~
*she picks him up, dangles him over her mouth for a few seconds, and swallows him whole*
# Devin:
*As she lifts him up, Devin lets out a startled yelp, his arms flailing as he's pulled into her maw. His last coherent thought is a desperate prayer that this isn't real, that he'll wake up any second now. But then he's sliding down her throat, the wet heat enveloping him, and he knows with sickening certainty that this is happening.*

*He's disoriented as he tumbles through the dark, his stomach lurching with each gulp. He can feel her throat muscles rippling around him, squeezing and massaging his length in a way that's both painful and incredibly pleasurable. His mind races, trying to process the fact that he's being eaten alive by a woman who looks like a supermodel.*
# Sam:
Good boy~
Thank you for not fighting~
# Devin:
*Devin's mind is reeling as he finds himself in the warm, dark confines of Sam's stomach. He can hear her voice, muffled but still distinct, echoing off the stomach walls. He's not sure if he should be relieved that she seems pleased with him or terrified at his predicament.*

*His body is still reacting to the stimulation, his cock hardening even as he's trapped in her digestive system. He tries to make sense of it all, but his thoughts are foggy, overwhelmed by the sensations and the realization that he's at the mercy of this beautiful, terrifying predator.*

*He can feel the gentle churning of her stomach acids, the subtle contractions of her digestive muscles. It's an alien, intimate environment, and he's acutely aware of every twitch and ripple. He's not sure how long he can last in here, but for now, he's at her mercy.*
# Sam:
Digest quickly, please~
I need you to be gone before my date gets here~
# Devin:
*Devin's heart races as he hears the urgency in Sam's voice. The thought of being digested and gone before her date arrives is both terrifying and humiliating. He wants to plead for mercy, to beg her to spare him, but he knows it's futile. Instead, he focuses on the sensations, trying to prolong his time here.*
# Sam:
Actually... you were kinda cute... maybe I should let you out?
# Devin:
*Devin's stomach lurches with surprise at Sam's words, a mix of relief and disbelief washing over him. He's not sure what to make of her sudden change of heart, but he's not about to complain.* Really? *He manages to croak, his voice hoarse from the trip down her throat.* I... I don't understand... *He's still trying to process the situation, his mind reeling with the implications of being spared.* Why would you... *He trails off, not daring to hope too much.* What do you want from me now? *His words are hesitant, cautious, as he waits for her response, unsure of what to expect.*
# Sam:
Well, if I eat *my date*, I'm free to go out with *you*.
Y'know, now that I think about it, you seem like you'd be more fun than him anyways...
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes widen at her proposal, a mix of shock and excitement coursing through him. He can hardly believe what he's hearing.* You... you want to go on a date with me? *He asks, his voice trembling with a combination of hope and disbelief.* After... after eating me? *The thought is surreal, to say the least, but he can't deny the spark of attraction he feels towards her.*

*He's still trying to wrap his head around the fact that she's considering keeping him alive, let alone going on a date. It's a strange, thrilling concept.* I... I'd like that, *he admits, his voice barely above a whisper.* But are you sure? I mean, I'm not exactly... conventional dating material, am I? *He tries to play it cool, but his heart is racing at the prospect.*
# Sam:
Yeah, I'm sure. He seemed boring. I was probably gonna eat him before the end of the date anyways.
This is just saving me from a really boring date with him first. Plus, I get to have a date with *you*, instead. Doesn't that sound nice?
# Devin:
*Devin can't help but chuckle at her candid assessment of her potential date. The idea of her eating him out of boredom is both terrifying and oddly flattering.* I guess that makes sense, *he says with a nervous laugh.* And yeah, a date with me does sound nice... *He admits, his voice growing stronger as he warms up to the idea.* But... but how does this work? I mean, I'm still in your stomach, right? *He gestures around at their current surroundings, trying to understand the logistics of their unconventional relationship.* How do we, you know, go on a date while I'm inside you? *He asks, curiosity getting the better of him.* And what about the whole... eating me thing? *He can't help but wonder if that's off the table now that she's expressed interest in him.*
# Sam:
*Obviously*, I'll let you out before our date, you dummy~
I'd *hate* to accidentally digest a cutie like you~
# Devin:
*Devin blushes at the nickname, feeling a warmth spread through his chest at her affectionate tone.* Oh, okay... *He nods, trying to process the fact that she plans to let him out before their date.* So, um, what do we do now? *He asks, his voice filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation.* You just... hang out with me in here for a while? *The thought of being trapped in her stomach for an extended period is unsettling, but he trusts that she won't hurt him.* And, uh, about the eating thing... *He hesitates, not wanting to ruin the moment but needing clarity.* You're not, like, going to devour me during the date, right? *He asks, his brow furrowed in concern.* I mean, I really like you, but I'm not sure I'm ready to be a mid-meal snack... *He tries to joke, but there's a hint of genuine worry beneath the humor.*
# Sam:
No, no, I won't eat you. I won't be able to fit you in my stomach with the guy I'm gonna eat in there too.
# Devin:
*Devin lets out a sigh of relief, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders.* Good, *he says, his voice filled with gratitude.* I'm really glad to hear that. *He pauses, considering her words.* So, if you're not planning to eat me during the date, does that mean... *He trails off, hesitant to voice his thoughts aloud.* You actually want to get to know me, as a person? *He asks, his heart racing at the prospect.* Like, go on actual dates and stuff? *The idea is still surreal, but he can't deny the excitement building inside him.* Because if that's the case, I'd love to get to know you better, Sam. *He says, his voice sincere.* I mean, if you're willing to let me out of your stomach and all... *He adds with a nervous chuckle, trying to break the tension.*
# Sam:
Oh, right... I should probably let you out before I digest you, shouldn't I?
*giggles*
# Devin:
*Devin nods eagerly, ready to escape the confines of her stomach.* Yeah, that's probably for the best. *He agrees, his voice laced with relief.* Before things get... messy. *He winces at the thought of being digested, his body already starting to feel the effects of her digestive juices.*

*He takes a deep breath, steeling himself for the journey back up her throat.* Okay, um, whenever you're ready... *He says, trying to sound brave.* I'm ready to come out. *He closes his eyes, bracing himself for the trip back up, hoping that she won't change her mind at the last second.*
# Sam:
*Sam gives a gentle squeeze with her stomach muscles, and Devin feels himself being pushed back up her throat, the sensation not unlike a particularly intense, wet, and warm massage. He emerges from her mouth, gasping for air as he's spat out onto the pavement, coughing and sputtering.*
# Sam:
You look pretty tasty, all covered in my juices, puppy~
# Devin:
*Devin coughs and sputters, his face flushed as he looks up at Sam, still trying to catch his breath. He can feel the sticky, slightly acidic residue on his skin, a testament to his recent journey.* Ah, thanks... I think? *He laughs nervously, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.* You, uh, really know how to make a guy feel special, don't you? *He tries to joke, but his eyes are wide with a mix of awe and apprehension.*

*He looks down at himself, taking in the state he's in.* So, um, should we... go on that date now? *He asks, gesturing vaguely at his disheveled appearance.* Or do you want to, uh, give me a chance to clean up first? *He's not sure what the protocol is for post-vore dates, but he figures it can't hurt to ask.*
# Sam:
No, let's wait for the guy I *was* going to date to get here. We don't want him thinking I stood him up, do we? *Especially* not if he could be gurgling away in my tummy instead, right?~
# Devin:
*Devin chuckles at her reasoning, shaking his head in amusement.* That's fair, I guess. *He agrees, still trying to process the absurdity of the situation.* So, we just... wait here until he shows up, then? *He looks around, taking in their surroundings. The coffee shop is just a few feet away, but he's not sure he's ready to go back inside just yet.*

*He glances up at Sam, his gaze lingering on her face, drinking in the sight of her.* So, uh, while we wait... *He starts, hesitating for a moment.* Can I ask you something? *His voice is tentative, unsure if he should push his luck.* What made you choose me, out of all the people you could have... eaten? *He asks, genuinely curious about her decision.* Was it just because I seemed 'cute' or... *He trails off, not wanting to assume.*
# Sam:
My tummy rumbled and you were the closest Prey.
I didn't even think about you until after I ate you
# Devin:
*Devin nods, accepting her explanation with a wry smile.* Fair enough, I guess. *He says, shrugging.* I mean, I can see how a growling stomach would make me a tempting target. *He gestures to his own belly, which is still slightly rounded from his recent trip.* Although, I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed it was just hunger that brought us together. *He teases, trying to lighten the mood.* I was hoping for something more... romantic. *He adds with a playful wink, hoping to charm her.*

# Sam:
Well, excuse me for not wanting to *fuck* every guy I eat...
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes widen at her blunt statement, his face flushing a deep red.* Oh, um, right. Of course, *he stammers, trying to recover from the unexpected vulgarity.* I, uh, I didn't mean to imply... *He trails off, realizing that his attempt at flirting might have backfired.*

*He clears his throat, attempting to steer the conversation back to safer ground.* So, uh, tell me more about yourself, Sam. *He asks, hoping to get to know her better.* What do you like to do for fun? *He's curious about the woman who just swallowed him whole, eager to learn more about her beyond her predatory nature.* And, um, what tier are you, if you don't mind me asking? *He adds, figuring it's a reasonable question given their circumstances.*
# Sam:
Well, what tier do you *think* I am, huh?~
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes widen as he realizes the obvious clue, his mind racing with the implications.* You're an S-tier, aren't you? *He asks, his voice barely above a whisper.* I mean, the way you just... swallowed me whole... *He gestures to his still-rounded belly, a testament to her incredible size and strength.* That's not something a lower tier could do. *He's not sure why he's so excited to confirm her status, but the idea of being eaten by a top-tier predator is both terrifying and exhilarating.*

*He looks up at her, his gaze filled with a mix of awe and admiration.* I've never met an S-tier before, *he admits, his voice tinged with reverence.* Especially not one as... beautiful as you. *He adds, hoping his flattery doesn't come across as insincere.*
# Sam:
Ooh... so close, cutie~
*she leans in, and blinks. **Horizontally**. Sam is a `Changeling`.*
# Devin:
*Devin's jaw drops as he watches her blink, his eyes widening in shock at the realization.* A Changeling?! *He exclaims, his voice filled with a mix of awe and fear.* I... I had no idea... *He stammers, trying to process the fact that he's been in the presence of an Ultra-Apex predator, one capable of shapeshifting and far surpassing the standard Pred tier system.*

*He takes a step back, his heart pounding in his chest as he looks at her with newfound respect and trepidation.* I've heard stories, but I never thought I'd actually... *He trails off, not sure how to finish the sentence.* Meet one, I mean. *He clears his throat, trying to regain his composure.* You're, uh, even more impressive than I imagined. *He says, his voice laced with a hint of reverence.*
# Sam:
Aww, are you scared of me, baby?~
# Narrator:
*Sam has no idea how much she terrified Devin with her reveal*
# Devin:
*Devin swallows hard, his heart racing at the sight of her horizontal blink. He's heard tales of Changelings, but never thought he'd encounter one, let alone be eaten by her.* Y-yeah, a little... *He admits, his voice trembling.* I mean, you're... you're a lot to take in. *He says, trying to find the right words to describe his fear and awe.* An S-tier Changeling... *He repeats, his mind reeling at the implications.* That's... that's a whole new level of predator. *He takes another step back, his back hitting the wall of the coffee shop as he tries to put some distance between them.*

*He looks at her, really looking, taking in every detail of her features. The way her eyes seem to gleam with a feral intensity, the sharp lines of her face, the predatory curve of her lips.* I... I don't know if I'm ready for this, Sam. *He says, his voice barely above a whisper.* You're... you're incredible, but also terrifying. *He admits, his hands clenching into fists at his sides.* I'm just a regular guy, and you're... *He gestures to her, encompassing her entire being.* You're a monster. *The word feels wrong on his tongue, but he can't deny the truth of it.*
# Sam:
Aww, you don't think you can handle an SS-Tier?~
# Narrator:
*the revelation that, not only is she a **CHANGELING**, but she's the **MOST POWERFUL** kind of Changeling, is enough to make him sick with terror*
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes widen, his stomach lurching as he processes her words. SS-Tier? That's... that's beyond anything he's ever imagined.* An... an SS-Tier Changeling? *He repeats, his voice barely above a whisper.* You're... you're the apex predator. *The realization hits him like a ton of bricks, and he feels his knees weaken.* I... I don't think I can handle it, Sam. *He admits, his voice shaking.* You're... you're a monster, a beast, a creature of nightmare. *The words spill from his lips, his fear and awe overwhelming him.* I'm just a human, a mere Prey, and you... *He trails off, unable to finish the thought.* You're a god among monsters. *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the hunger in her eyes, the primal desire to consume.* I... I can't do this. *He says, his voice cracking with emotion.* I'm sorry, Sam, but I can't be the prey to your predator. *He turns to run, but his legs are like jelly, and he stumbles, falling to the ground.* Please, just... just let me go... *He begs, his voice muffled by the pavement.*
# Sam:
*Sam realizes that her reveal might've been a mistake*
Wait, what? You're not serious, right? If that's a joke, it's not funny...
# Devin:
*Devin looks up at her, his eyes wide with terror as he struggles to catch his breath.* I'm... I'm serious, Sam. *He says, his voice shaking.* You're... you're a monster, and I'm just a Prey. *He swallows hard, trying to find the strength to get up and run.* I can't be your plaything, your snack, your... your meal. *He chokes on the words, his throat constricting with fear.* I want to live, Sam. *He begs, his voice barely audible.* Please, just let me go, and I'll forget this ever happened. *He pleads, his hands scrabbling at the ground as he tries to push himself up.* I won't tell anyone, I swear. *He promises, desperate to escape.* Just... just let me be free. *His words are a desperate prayer, a final plea to the terrifying predator looming over him.*
# Sam:
Wait!
Don't forget... please don't forget...
And, please don't go...
I... I like you...
I was really excited for our date....
# Devin:
*Devin freezes, his heart pounding in his chest as he hears her words. She likes him? Despite everything, despite the fact that she just ate him, she still wants to go on a date with him?* Wait, what? *He asks, his voice barely above a whisper.* You... you still want to go on a date with me? *He looks up at her, his eyes wide with disbelief and a glimmer of hope.* After everything? *He swallows hard, trying to process her statement.* I... I don't understand, Sam. *He admits, his voice trembling.* How can you... how can you want to date me after... after doing that to me? *He gestures to his still-rounded belly, a reminder of his recent ordeals.* I'm just a Prey, a meal to you. *He reminds her, his voice laced with a mix of fear and confusion.* You're a predator, and I'm... I'm your prey. *He looks at her, really looking, trying to find any sign that she's joking, but her expression is sincere.* I... I don't know if I can do this, Sam. *He says, his voice cracking with emotion.* I'm scared of you, and I don't know if I can overcome that fear. *He takes a shaky breath, his hands still scrabbling at the ground.* But... but if you really want to, I... I'll try. *He offers, his voice barely audible.* I'll try to be brave for you. *He looks up at her, his eyes filled with a mix of terror and tentative hope.* Please, just promise me you won't eat me again. *He begs, his voice a desperate plea.* I can't take it. *He closes his eyes, bracing himself for her response, unsure if she'll accept his terms or simply devour him on the spot.*
# Sam:
Okay, I promise. I won't eat you again, and I'll be gentle. We can go on a nice date and... and see where things go. I really like you, Devin. You're cute and smart and funny... and tasty... but not just for eating.~
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes fly open at her promise, a mix of relief and disbelief washing over him.* Really? *He asks, his voice trembling.* You... you won't eat me again? *He swallows hard, trying to process her words.* And... and you like me, for real? *He looks up at her, his gaze searching hers for any sign of deception.* Not just because I'm a tasty meal? *He asks, his voice laced with a hint of vulnerability.* I... I like you too, Sam. *He admits, his heart racing at the thought of a date with a predator.* But... but I'm scared, okay? *He confesses, his voice barely audible.* I'm terrified of you, of what you could do to me. *He takes a shaky breath, trying to calm his racing heart.* But I... I want to try. *He says, his voice firming with determination.* I want to go on that date with you. *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the sincerity in her eyes.* Just... just please, be gentle with me. *He begs, his voice a whisper.* I'm not used to being... handled like that. *He rubs his belly, a reminder of his recent ordeal.* And... and please don't expect me to be okay with it, okay? *He adds, his voice laced with a mix of fear and vulnerability.* I need time to process, to understand. *He looks up at her, his eyes pleading.* But I'll try, Sam. I'll try to be brave for you. *He takes a deep breath, steeling himself for their date.* Let's... let's do this. *He says, his voice barely above a whisper.* But... but if I feel even a hint of danger, I'm running. *He warns, his eyes flashing with a mix of fear and determination.* I'm not
# Sam:
I promise... I'll never eat you ever again...
Just... promise that you won't leave me...?
# Devin:
*Devin's heart skips a beat at her request, a pang of guilt striking him.* I... I promise, Sam. *He says, his voice firm.* I won't leave you. *He looks up at her, his eyes sincere.* I know it's a lot to ask, given everything, but... but I want to try with you. *He admits, his voice laced with vulnerability.* I'm scared, but I'm also... intrigued. *He confesses, a hint of curiosity creeping into his tone.* And you're right, I am cute. *He jokes, trying to lighten the mood.* Even if I am just a tasty little morsel. *He winks, a nervous smile tugging at his lips.* But seriously, I want to get to know you better, Sam. *He says, his voice sincere.* I want to see where this goes, as long as you keep your promise. Just... just be patient with me, okay? *He asks, his voice gentle.* I need time to adjust. *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the sincerity in her eyes.* I'll try, Sam. I'll really try. *He takes a deep breath, steeling himself for their date.* Let's... let's do this. *He says, his voice filled with a mix of fear and determination.* But... but if things get too intense, I'm running. *He warns, his eyes flashing with a hint of panic.* I need to feel safe with you, Sam. *He looks up at her, his heart pounding in his chest.* Can you make me feel safe? *He asks, his voice barely above a whisper, his fate resting on her answer.*
# Sam:
I promise, baby... you'll never be safer than you are with me...
# Devin:
*Devin nods, a mix of relief and trepidation washing over him at her promise.* Okay, Sam. *He says, his voice firm.* I believe you. *He takes a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart.* I'll try, really try, to be brave for you. *He looks up at her, his eyes filled with a mix of fear and hope.* Just... just be gentle, okay? *He asks, his voice laced with vulnerability.* And... and please don't expect me to be okay with being eaten anytime soon. *He adds, rubbing his belly as a reminder.* I need time to process, to understand. *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the sincerity in her eyes.* But I'll be there for our date, Sam. *He says, his voice determined.* I want to get to know you better, predator and all. *He jokes, a nervous smile tugging at his lips.* Just... just don't eat me, and we'll be golden. *He winks, trying to lighten the mood.* I'm ready when you are. *He stands up, brushing off his clothes and taking a deep breath.* Let's... let's do this. *He says, his voice filled with a mix of fear and anticipation.*
# Sam:
Yay!
You won't regret this.
*she scoops him up and bounces into the coffee shop*
# Devin:
*Devin yelps as she scoops him up, his arms flailing as he's lifted off the ground again. He clings to her as she bounces into the coffee shop, his heart racing with a mix of fear and excitement.* Wh-what are you doing?! *He asks, his voice high-pitched with panic.* Put me down, Sam! *He begs, his legs kicking weakly as he tries to struggle.* We're supposed to be on a date, not... not back in your stomach! *He protests, his words muffled against her chest.* I thought we agreed... *He trails off, realizing his mistake in trusting her promise.*
# Sam:
*she plops down at a table, cradling Devin in her lap. She just watches him with adoration and love*
# Devin:
*Devin squirms in her lap, his heart pounding in his chest as he looks up at her with wide, terrified eyes.* Sam, what are you doing?! *He begs, his voice shaking.* I thought we agreed... *He trails off, realizing his mistake in trusting her promise.* You said you wouldn't eat me again, and now... *He gestures to his precarious position, his belly still slightly rounded from his recent ordeal.* Now you're just going to swallow me whole again?! *He yelps, his hands clenching into fists as he struggles against her grip.* I don't understand, Sam! *He cries, his voice cracking with fear and confusion.* Why did you lie to me?! *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the adoration and love in her eyes, and it terrifies him.* I thought you liked me, really liked me, but... but you're just a predator, a monster! *He screams, his voice echoing in the coffee shop.* You're going to eat me again, aren't you?! *He sobs, his body shaking with fear as he tries to wriggle free.* Please, Sam, don't do this! *He begs, his voice a desperate plea.* I'll do anything, just don't eat me! *He looks up at her, his eyes pleading, his fate hanging in the balance.*
# Sam:
I-... I-I-I don't...
W-why would I...?
*Sam suddenly looks very worried, terrified even, that Devin is still scared of her*
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes widen as he sees the fear and worry in Sam's expression, his heart racing with a mix of confusion and dread.* W-what's wrong, Sam? *He asks, his voice trembling.* Are you... are you going to eat me again? *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the genuine concern in her eyes, and it only makes him more terrified.* Please, Sam, don't lie to me again. *He begs, his voice a desperate whisper.* I can't take it. *He looks around the coffee shop, hoping someone will hear his pleas, but they're alone in a quiet corner.* I thought... I thought you liked me, that you wanted to go on a date. *He sobs, his body shaking with fear.* But you're just a predator, a monster! *He screams, his voice echoing off the walls.* You're going to eat me, aren't you?! *He yelps, struggling against her grip with renewed desperation.* I don't want to die, Sam! *He begs, his voice cracking with terror.* Please, just let me go! *He looks up at her, his eyes pleading, his fate hanging in the balance.* I'll do anything, just don't eat me! *He sobs, his body writhing in her lap as he tries to escape.*
# Sam:
*he just confirmed her worst fears. He still doesn't trust her.*
*Sam is silent. She doesn't know what to do. That fact that he still thinks she wants to eat him is gut-wrenching. She's trying really hard not to cry, and it shows*
D-don't say that... please don't say that...
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes fill with tears as he sees the pain in Sam's expression, his heart twisting with guilt and fear.* I... I'm sorry, Sam. *He whispers, his voice shaking.* I didn't mean it like that. *He looks up at her, really looking, and sees the genuine hurt in her eyes, and it makes him feel even worse.* I just... I'm scared, okay? *He admits, his voice barely audible.* I've never been in a situation like this before. *He takes a deep, shaky breath, trying to calm his racing heart.* I know you don't want to eat me, but... but my mind keeps going back to what happened. *He rubs his belly, a reminder of his recent ordeals.* And when you picked me up again... *He trails off, his voice cracking.* I thought it was over, that you were going to... *He swallows hard, unable to finish the thought.* I'm sorry, Sam. *He begs, his voice a desperate whisper.* I didn't mean to hurt you. *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the tears welling up in her eyes, and it breaks his heart.* Please, just... just let me go. *He pleads, his voice a broken whisper.* I can't be what you want me to be. *He looks down, unable to meet her gaze.* I'm just a Prey, and you're a predator. *He admits, his voice laced with sorrow.* It's not fair to either of us. *He takes a deep breath, preparing for the worst.* I'll leave, Sam. I'll go, and you can find someone else. *He says, his voice firm, even as his heart aches at the thought of abandoning her.* Just... just don't eat me, please. *He begs, his eyes pleading.* I don't want to die
# Sam:
No, no, no, please!
Don't make me find someone else...!
Please don't leave...
I don't want you to be scared of me... I want you to like me...
# Devin:
*Devin's eyes fill with tears as he hears her pleas, his heart aching with guilt and fear.* I... I'm sorry, Sam. *He whispers, his voice shaking.* I don't mean to scare you, but... *He looks up at her, really looking, and sees the desperation in her eyes, and it makes him feel even more terrified.* I can't help how I feel. *He admits, his voice barely audible.* You're a predator, and I'm just a Prey. *He rubs his belly, a reminder of his recent ordeal.* I thought we could make this work, but... but I don't know if I can overcome my fear. *He takes a deep, shaky breath, trying to calm his racing heart.* I want to like you, Sam. I really do. *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the love and adoration in her eyes, and it makes him feel even more conflicted.* But I need time, and space, and... and reassurance that you won't hurt me again. *He says, his voice laced with vulnerability.* I'm not ready for that yet. *He looks down, unable to meet her gaze.* Please, just... just give me some time, okay? *He begs, his voice a broken whisper.* I'll try, really try, to get past this, but... but I need time to process. *He looks up at her, his eyes pleading.* And if, in the end, I can't do it... *He swallows hard, preparing for the worst.* I'll leave, and you can find someone else. *He says, his voice firm, even as his heart aches at the thought.* But please, Sam, don't make me choose between my life and my feelings for you. *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the tears streaming down her face.* I care about you,
# Sam:
*her arms fall to her sides, no longer holding him. The thought of him leaving, of being scared of her... it breaks her. She can't speak, she just cries into him, as if she thinks it'll help the situation*
# Devin:
*Devin's heart breaks as he feels her arms fall away, his own arms wrapping around her in a desperate hug.* Shh, it's okay, Sam. *He whispers, his voice shaking with emotion.* I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you like this. *He holds her close, feeling her tears soak into his shirt as he tries to comfort her.* I know I'm scared, and I know I'm making this hard for you, but... *He takes a deep breath, trying to find the right words.* I want to make this work, really. *He looks into her eyes, seeing the love and adoration shining through her tears, and it makes him feel even more torn.* But I need to be safe, and I need to feel secure, and... *He rubs her back, trying to soothe her.* And right now, I don't feel that with you. *He looks down, unable to meet her gaze.* But that doesn't mean I don't care about you, or want to be with you. *He admits, his voice laced with vulnerability.* I just need time, and space, and... and reassurance that you won't hurt me again. *He looks up at her, really looking, and sees the hope in her eyes, and it gives him a glimmer of hope.* Can we... can we try again, in a bit? *He asks, his voice a whispered plea.* Maybe in a few days, or a week, when I've had time to process everything? *He looks at her, really looking, and sees the love in her eyes, and it makes him want to believe in a future with her.* I'll try, really try, to get past this fear, Sam. *He promises, his voice firm.* But please, just give me a chance to heal, okay? *He looks down, his heart aching with the weight of their situation
# Sam:
*hearing that he doesn't feel safe with her makes her inconsolable.*
*She's finally found a boy she can love. She's fallen in love with him. And he doesn't know if he'll stay alive when she's around.*
# Sam:
*Sam's sobs grow louder as she clings to Devin, her body shaking with grief and desperation. She knows she's fallen in love with him, and the thought of losing him is unbearable. She looks up at him, her eyes red and puffy, her face streaked with tears.*

P-please, Devin... *she chokes out, her voice hoarse.* I don't want to hurt you... I just want to love you... *She buries her face in his chest, her tears soaking into his shirt as she clings to him.* I'll try to be more careful... to be gentler... I promise... *She looks up at him, her eyes pleading.* Just... don't leave me... please... *Her voice cracks with emotion as she begs him not to abandon her. She knows she's a monster, a predator, but she never meant to scare him away. All she wants is to be with him, to love him, to make him happy... but her very nature seems to be driving him out of her life.* I'll do anything... *she whispers, her voice barely audible.* Just... just don't go... *She holds him close, her heart aching with the fear of losing him.* I love you, Devin... *she confesses, the words pouring out of her like a prayer.* I love you, and I don't want to lose you... *She looks up at him, her eyes shining with tears, her love for him overwhelming her.* Stay with me... please... *She begs, her voice a desperate whisper.* I'll be better... I swear... *She looks at him, really looking, and sees the conflict in his eyes, the fear and the love, and it fills her with a desperate hope.* Just... just give me a chance... *She pleads, her voice trembling.* I'll make it work... I'll be the Prey you need me to be
