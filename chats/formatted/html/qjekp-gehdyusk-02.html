They're completely in my mercy at that point, and they can't do nothing about it.

It's not something she wants to acknowledge, of course, but she can't ignore the way she feels, both guilty and strangely vulnerable.</i><br><br>"You don't trust that I won't, uhm... hurt you, or.. or..."<br><br><i>She trails off, struggling to find the words to say it.</i><br><br><i>She huffs again, the pout now growing more and more pronounced. It makes her look like a sulky little girl who's just been told that Santa's not real, and who doesn't quite know what to do with that reality. She's trying so hard to remain confident, to push that vulnerability aside and put on her usual cool and tough persona, but the thought that you don't trust her is hitting her much harder than she thought it would.</i><br><br>"You don't trust that I won't... <i>eat</i> you."<br><br><i>The word, spoken aloud, suddenly makes it all feel so real and so scary. You're not just being stubborn or overprotective. You're actually afraid that this girl, with the pretty blonde bob of hair and the perfect curves and the sharp blue eyes, is actually a predator, and you don't feel safe with her. It's like suddenly the veil has been lifted and the whole thing feels much more real and much scarier.</i><br><br>"I won't eat you, you know. I won't..."<br><br><i>She suddenly huffs again, the words slipping out before she can stop them.</i><br><br>"You know I'm not a monster, right? I'm not going to... kill you or anything. You're not some kind of... snack for me to enjoy after a long run. You're a person! And..."<br><br><i>She swallows, the words suddenly feeling more and more difficult to say. The expression on her face has suddenly gone from a pout to a mix of guilt, shame, and a hint of a pleading look in her blue eyes.</i><br><br><i>She's fighting to keep her composure and the confident attitude and the cool demeanor, the one she loves to wear so much, but she can't seem to keep it up. Her face looks a little pale, as if the realization of just how badly she's messed up finally hit her like a punch in the gut. The idea that you don't trust her to not just turn around and eat you alive for a quick snack suddenly feels so much more real and so much more terrifying.</i><br><br>"I'm not going to eat you."<br><br><i>There's a hint of a pleading quality to the words now, as if she wants so desperately to convince you to believe her, to make you feel safe and secure with her. Her eyes dart all around your face, as if searching for some sign that you're starting to believe her, some sign that you might actually trust her. Her tone is much softer now, so much more earnest and genuine, and the hint of a pout is still there, making her look like an insecure little girl instead of a powerful and dangerous predator.</i><br><br>"You have... to trust me."<br><br><i>She's still not making eye contact in any great depth - she's still not completely able to face you now, now that she's finally admitted to herself the extent of the damage she did to you - but she's making more eye contact now than she was earlier. Her eyes are soft and pleading, but they also still have a hint of a warning look in them.</i><br><br>"I won't eat you, okay? You just have to trust me, alright? You don't have to be scared right now..."<br><br><i>She swallows once more, trying to keep her voice steady and her expression steady. Her hands feel so awkward, now, and she's not even sure what to do with them. She wants to reach out and try to touch you, to grab your arm and squeeze your hand or run a finger over your cheek, but she's not sure if she even has the right to now, not after she's just screwed up this badly. It feels like all the confidence she usually exudes like a warm cloak around her has just vanished, and she suddenly feels small and vulnerable now.</i><br><br><i>Her hands are now clenching and unclenching, and she's taken a shaky step closer, her body now once again pressed up against yours. She's so close now, her body's scent hitting your nose - that floral, light, sweet scent you've been trying to push out of your mind - and suddenly the need to be close to you is overwhelming. Her body is so warm against yours, and she suddenly just feels the intense urge to be so close and to hold on to you. She wraps her arms around your torso in a shaky embrace, pressing her face into your chest.</i><br><br><i>She nuzzles into your chest with a soft little sigh, and her nose is suddenly filled with the scent of your body, the warmth of your skin, and the subtle, deep, male smell that is just so distinctly you. You can feel the soft little sigh coming from her as she presses her face into your skin, and can feel her arms wrap around you with a sense of desperate need, and her body's weight pressing you against the concrete wall behind you.</i><br><br><i>She's pressed so close to you now with her body, her head buried into your chest and her embrace so tight. You can feel the rapid rise and fall of her chest, the quick little hitches of air catching in her throat, and her fingers clenching tightly against you, her nails digging into your skin as if by some instinct. She's fighting so hard to keep herself from breaking down, and the effort feels like it's slowly killing her. You can hear the little whimper coming from her throat as she nuzzles even harder into your chest.</i></body><!DOCTYPE html><head></head><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/github-markdown-css/5.8.1/github-markdown-dark.css" integrity="sha512-XNBMUjy86G874D+6YN8vaBJpEut/Q0IafwiWxO5CoZDyaVXxbzyzacBpA55GPYhetzeLhxUbgdETrigRIVeNqQ==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><style>.markdown-body{margin:0 auto;padding:45px;}@media(max-width:767px){.markdown-body{padding:15px;}}</style><body class="markdown-body"><h1>Devin:</h1>hey... kris...<br>are you okay?</body><!DOCTYPE html><head></head><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/github-markdown-css/5.8.1/github-markdown-dark.css" integrity="sha512-XNBMUjy86G874D+6YN8vaBJpEut/Q0IafwiWxO5CoZDyaVXxbzyzacBpA55GPYhetzeLhxUbgdETrigRIVeNqQ==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /><style>.markdown-body{margin:0 auto;padding:45px;}@media(max-width:767px){.markdown-body{padding:15px;}}</style><body class="markdown-body"><h1>Kristina:</h1><i>It takes her a second to respond, her voice coming in a shaky little reply against your chest.</i><br><br>"Y-Yeah, I'm fine.
