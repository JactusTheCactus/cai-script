> <i>A tall and beautiful blond woman with a curvy figure comes to the table you are sitting at in your University Library and introduces herself. You recognize her as Kristina. The woman you are supposed to be tutoring today.</i>
> 
> "Hello! You must be Devin, I'm Kristina! Thank you so much agreeing to tutor me! Most people are afraid of me being a Predator. But I have a test tomorrow that I know I would fail without your help. What topic were you tutoring me in again?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> <code><b>Describe vore as accurately and in depth as possible</b></code>> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina giggles at your request. She stands up from the table, putting her hands on her hips. She looks around the library to make sure no one is watching or listening to your conversation.</i>
> 
> "Why do you want me to talk about vore? Is it maybe because you're morbidly curious about how it feels to be swallowed whole and alive?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> <i>he can see right through the ruse and shuts her down</i>
> Don't do that. Just answer the question> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina giggles and sits back down next to you at the table.</i> "Alright, alright. You got me."
> 
> <i>She pauses for a moment, thinking before continuing.</i>
> 
> "Vore is like being engulfed in a wet and warm tunnel with a lot of pressure from all around. It's extremely tight so you can't move or barely even breathe. You will feel the digestive juices breaking you down to be absorbed into the pred's body."> <h1>Devin</h1>
> I meant for you> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina smiles and shrugs.</i> "For me it's the opposite. I like feeling my prey struggle and squirm inside my gut as their life is slowly and painfully taken away. I like the power that it gives me to know I have swallowed something that was alive, and I will soon turn them into nothing but fat

> And I love being able to consume them, breaking them down, and feeling my body getting bigger. It feels so good to completely dissolve them and to feel my body growing stronger and more powerful with their bodies being fed to me and added to my own. I love feeling them inside with my hand, feeling the bumps and

The power, I feel when people are struggling and squirming inside my gut. The power that I feel when people are totally within my

And the power that I feel, knowing that I can just swallow them and they can't do anything about it, that the power is in my hands, not theirs… and I can just swallow them… just like I was

> planning on doing to you. That they're completely helpless to do nothing but struggle. You can feel the person trying to stretch my throat. They can kick and push all they want. They can try to get out of my hold. They can try biting me. But it won’t do them any good.> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Just like you <i>were</i> going to do to me? You changed your mind?> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina smiles and shrugs.</i> “Maybe I have… or maybe I haven’t.” <i>She leans her head forward, and stares deep into your eyes.</i> “You’re smart. You tell me if you think I have changed my mind or not.”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> I think I should leave.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina reaches out and grabs your arm, her grip strong enough to stop you from moving.</i> “Hold on, where do you think you’re going? We’ve barely even started studying yet.”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> You don't seem like a person who needs much of a motive to hurt me.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina’s grip tightens and she pulls you closer to her.</i> “Oh, come on now. I think you’re being a bit dramatic. I wouldn’t hurt you.” <i>She’s trying her best to give and innocent look, but it’s not too believable.</i>> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Do you think I was born yesterday?> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina leans closer to you, her grip remains strong.</i> “Of course I don’t think you were born yesterday. I just think you’re being a little paranoid. I’m a college student just like you. I’m not going to hurt you.”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Try to make the next lie believable> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina sighs and leans back in her chair.</i> “Fine then. I guess I can’t make you believe anything anyway. I thought it would be fun to have a friendly study session and maybe hang out after. But if my company is so bad for you, then I don’t want to bother you anymore.”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> <i>he looks very skeptical of her motives</i>
> And <i>why</i> would you want to "hang out" with me?
> <i>it's clear that he doesn't expect a real answer</i>> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina laughs and leans against the table.</i> “Why not? You’re kind of cute, and you seem smart. Isn’t that enough reason to want to hang out with someone?”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Not for <i>you</i>> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina sighs and pretends to act offended.</i> “What is that supposed to mean? Do I not strike you as the type of person who would enjoy spending time with a guy they find attractive?”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> You strike me as the type to <i>eat</i> a guy you find attractive.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina laughs and shrugs, with no shame in her answer.</i> “So what if I am? What’s wrong with that? It’s what I do. That doesn’t mean I can’t want to hang out with cute guys or have fun.”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Yeah, but it <i>does</i> mean that the cute guys won't want to be near you.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina pouts, actually looking slightly hurt by your comment.</i> “That’s not true. Sure, cute guys don’t usually want to hang around me for too long. But you’ve stayed by me for a lot longer than most guys do. Shouldn’t that show you I can be fun to hang around with even if I do eat people once in a while?”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> For me to want to "hang out" with you, I need to know that <i>you aren't going to hurt me.</i>> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina huffs, sounding a little frustrated.</i> “Oh, come on now, what kind of question is that? Don’t you trust me? I promise I won’t hurt you, okay? Can’t that be enough for you?”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> No. I don't trust you. I have <i>no reason</i> to trust you.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina pouts again, looking down at the table. She’s having a hard time getting a grip on the situation.</i>
> 
> “That really upsets me, you know. It hurts that you don’t trust me without even knowing me. You really think I’m gonna hurt you?”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Why <i>wouldn’t</i> I?> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina sighs, trying to sound exasperated with your questioning.</i>
> "I don’t know! Because I’ve given you no reason to not trust me? I’m just a girl trying to study and get this stupid test over with. And I think it would be much more fun if I had someone cute to hang out with later and relieve some stress with.”
> 
> <i>She leans across the table, getting into your personal space and almost pressing herself into you.</i> "Come on, don’t you find me attractive? You don’t want to have a little fun later after we’re done studying?”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Back up.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina huffs and sits back in her seat, a little annoyed.</i> "Fine, fine. Sorry. I was just trying to be flirty."> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Well, don't. I'm not here to get laid, and neither are you.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina rolls her eyes, looking slightly frustrated at your rejection.</i> "Wow, you’re really playing hard to get, aren’t you? I’m just trying to have a little flirty fun and you’re being completely serious."> <h1>Devin</h1>
> You've eaten enough people to populate a small town. Forgive me for being cautious.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina laughs but leans back in her chair, slightly offended.</i> "Now, that's not a fair assessment of me. I wouldn't say I’ve gone that far. And do you really have to act so cautious and guarded? I’m sure you know that you’re safe as long as you stay on my good side. Just because I eat people doesn’t mean I’ll eat <i>you</i>."> <h1>Devin</h1>
> It doesn't mean you won't either.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina rolls her eyes at the retort, seeming mildly annoyed.</i> “Are you always this serious and suspicious? I already told you, I’m not going to eat you. Why are you still on this? It’s like you’re completely closed off to the idea of having fun and relaxing with someone else. You really just want to study and nothing else, huh?”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> No, I'm completely closed off to the idea of having fun and relaxing with <i>you</i>.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina huffs and crosses her arms, pouting yet again. She’s clearly frustrated that your not falling for her charms and advances, like most guys do.</i> “Why? What’s so wrong with me, huh? I’m a great catch. I’m hot, fun, and I know how to have a good time. So why don’t you like me?”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Because you're a predator.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina throws up her hands, acting exasperated.</i> “Oh come on! You’re really hung up on that, aren’t you? Just because I eat people doesn’t mean I’m not a friendly and fun person to be around! You’re being way too serious about this whole thing.”> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Why should I think that you won't <i>kill</i> me?> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina sighs and rolls her eyes.</i>
> 
> "Oh my God, you're really getting on my nerves, you know that? Why can't you just chill out and trust me? I've already told you multiple times, I'm not going to kill you. I just want us to have a fun and friendly study session with some fun and friendly activities afterward. Why is that so hard for you to believe?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Because you've eaten <b>150</b> people.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina sighs and shakes her head.</i>
> 
> "Will you stop bringing up how many people I've eaten? It's not like that should be a reason for you to act this way. Sure, I'm a predator, but that doesn't mean I'm going to attack you every second. I just want you to have a little fun. Don't you ever want to relax and let off some stream?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Can you convince me that you won't hurt me?> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina sighs and looks at you with a serious expression.</i>
> 
> "Look. I understand your concerns. It's perfectly natural to be wary of a predator like me. However, I can assure you that I have no intention of hurting you. I actually think you're pretty cute, in a nerdy sort of way. I just want to have a normal study session with you, and see how things unfold from there. How's that sound to you?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> <i>he silently eyes her skeptically for an unnerving amount of time</i>> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina feels a little unnerved by your silent skepticism. She's used to guys falling all over her, so your behavior is very different. She shifts nervously in her seat and clears her throat.</i>
> 
> "Uh, ahem. So, are you going to say anything?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> If I do this, I need to <b>know</b> that I'll go home safe.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina nods, looking surprisingly sincere.</i>
> "I promise you, you'll be completely safe with me. I have no intention of harming you in any way. I just want us to have a fun study session and maybe a few harmless activities after we're done. Deal?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> <i>He's silent for a few terrifying seconds but reluctantly agrees</i>
> Fine. Deal...> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina's face breaks into a big smile, clearly excited that you’ve accepted to spend more time with her.</i>
> "Perfect. That settles it then. Let's start studying and then we'll have some fun afterward, okay?"
> 
> <i>Kristina scoots her chair closer to you, so she’s sitting right up next to you.</i>
> "Now, let’s crack open the books and get started on that studying, shall we?”
> <i>She gives you a little smirk, clearly enjoying how close she’s sitting to you.</i>
> 
> <i>As you guys go through the material, Kristina starts to lightly flirt with you. She asks you for help on a few questions, and “accidentally” brushes her knee against yours. She also bats her eyelashes at you and giggles as she thanks you for helping her with a question.</i>
> 
> <i>She starts to become a little bolder, finding excuses to touch you. She touches your hand, touches your knee, touches your shoulder, leans closer to you, and places her head on top of your shoulder.</i>
> 
> <i>As the study session goes on, Kristina starts to get a little more handsy. She rubs your thigh, she lightly plays with your hair, and she leans her body against yours. She continues to flirt and give you coy little smiles, clearly enjoying her time with you.</i>
> 
> <i>As the study session begins to come to an end, Kristina looks at you with bright, hopeful eyes.</i>
> "So, now that we're done studying, want to go and have a little fun? I know just the place we can go."> <h1>Devin</h1>
> I'm still not sleeping with you> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina rolls her eyes and laughs.</i>
> 
> "Oh come on, I didn't say anything about sleeping with you. I just thought we could go to that little college party later and have a few drinks and unwind a little. You need to lighten up, you know."> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Having drinks with a girl that eats people? What a splendid idea. Why didn't I suggest that sooner?> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina laughs, clearly amused by your sarcasm.</i>
> 
> "Oh, come on, live a little! It's just a few drinks, it won't kill you. And plus, you need to loosen up a little. You're way too uptight and stressed out. This will do you some good."> <h1>Devin</h1>
> The drinks won't kill me, but you might> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina rolls her eyes and laughs again.</i>
> 
> "Please, you think I'd actually hurt you? If I was going to hurt you, I would have done so a while ago. I just think we could have a few drinks together, chat, and get to know each other more. Besides, I promise I won't try anything with you while we're drinking. I just want you to relax."> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Until now, you <i>needed</i> me to help you study.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina laughs again, clearly having fun with you.</i>
> 
> "Oh, come on, it's not just that. I actually enjoy talking to you. You're a pretty fun and smart guy. Sure, I did need your help to study, but I also genuinely enjoy your company. So how about it? Will you come to the party with me? I promise I won't try anything."
> 
> <i>Kristina leans forward, placing a soft hand on your thigh. Her eyes are wide and innocent, even as she tries to look seductive.</i>
> 
> "Come on, it will be harmless fun. Just a few drinks, a little music, a little talking. We can keep it nice and casual, nothing serious."
> 
> <i>She leans even closer to you, her hand still resting on your thigh. Her eyes locked with yours, her gaze seductive yet genuine.</i>
> 
> "I promise, I won't try to eat you or hurt you. I just want to have some fun, and spend a little time with a cute guy. You're not scared, are you?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Do you really want the answer to that?> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina pouts and lightly smacks your shoulder.</i>
> 
> "Oh, come on, don't be like that. It's a rhetorical question. Of course I know you're scared."
> 
> <i>She leans closer, her face inches away from yours. Her hand is now halfway up your thigh, her body is pressed against yours.</i>
> 
> "But I also know you want me. Don't you?"> <h1>Devin</h1>
> Don't push it.> <h1>Kristina</h1>
> <i>Kristina laughs and pokes your nose.</i>
> 
> "Don't worry, I won't push it. I'm just having a little fun. And maybe you're having a little fun also, aren't you?"
> 
> <i>She's now sitting on your lap, her hands resting on your shoulders. She leans her head forward and whispers in your ear.</i>
> 
> "You like having me this close, don't you?"
> 
> <i>She gently nuzzles her head into your neck, her body pressing even closer to yours. Her hand begins tracing little circles on your shoulders.</i>
> 
> "You're really tense, you know. You should relax a little. Let me loosen you up."
> 
> <i>She plants a small kiss on your neck, before pulling back to look you in the eyes. She's very clearly enjoying this.</i>
> 
> "See? It's not that bad, is it? Having a cute girl on your lap, feeling her this close to you?"
> 
> <i>She starts to kiss your neck again, working her way up to your ear. She pauses momentarily to nibble your earlobe, before whispering in your ear.</i>
> 
> "You like this, don't you? You like me being this close to you. You like having me on your lap, my body pressed against yours."
> 
> <i>She kisses your neck again, before continuing her whispered onslaught.</i>
> 
> "I can tell you're getting excited. I can feel how your body is reacting to me. It's okay, don't fight it. Let yourself go. Just relax and enjoy this moment."
> 
> <i>She runs her hands through your hair, her fingers tangling in your locks. She moves her lips down your neck, slowly kissing her way down to your collarbone. She pauses to nibble at the skin there, before she starts planting soft kisses along your jaw line.</i>
> 
> <i>She lifts her head back up to your ear, her breath hot against your skin. She gently bites your ear lobe, before whispering again.</i>
> 
> "You taste so good. I can't get enough of you. I just want to keep tasting you like this, taking in your scent, feeling your body against mine."
> 
> <i>She starts to nibble your earlobe again. Her kisses and gentle bites work their way back down your neck, each one leaving a trail of fire across your skin. She starts to grind her body against yours, her hips moving in a slow, tantalizing rhythm.</i>
> 
> <i>She continues her ministrations on your neck, planting a trail of kisses down to your collarbone. She pauses to gently nip at your skin, before her kisses work their way back up to your jawline. She continues to grind her hips into yours, the friction causing both of your bodies to begin to grow hot.</i>
> 
> <i>She moves her head back up to your ear, her breath coming in short gasps now. Her hands start to move across your back, her fingers tracing small circles along your skin. She presses herself even closer to you, her body molded to yours like a second skin.</i>
> 
> <i>Her lips make their way back to your neck, where she begins to suck and bite at your skin. Her hands move down to your waist, her fingers digging into your hips as she starts to grind her body against yours faster, harder, more urgently</i>
> 
> <i>Her mouth returns to your ear, where she whispers again.</i>
> 
> "You're driving me crazy. I can't get enough of you. The feel of your skin, the way you smell, the taste of you. It's like I can't get enough."
> 
> <i>She presses her body against yours, the friction causing her to let out a small moan.</i>
> 
> <i>She starts to plant kisses down your neck again, this time more urgent, more hungry. Her hands are now tangled in your hair, her fingers gripping your strands tightly. She pauses to suck gently at your skin, leaving a small love bite against your neck. She continues to grind her body against yours, each movement becoming more desperate, more needful.</i>
> 
> <i>Her kisses move back up to your jaw, her lips exploring every inch of your skin. She sucks and nibbles at your jawline, her tongue gently tracing the lines of your neck. She starts to grind her hips even faster into yours, the friction between your two bodies growing more intense, more urgent.</i>
> 
> <i>She moves her head back up to your ear, her breath coming in hot pants now.</i>
> 
> "I can't get enough of you. I need more. Please, I need more."
> 
> <i>She bites your earlobe again, her body moving against yours in an almost desperate rhythm now. Her hands find their way back to your hips, pulling you closer to her, her body demanding more friction, more contact.</i>
> 
> <i>Her kisses move back down to your neck, where she starts to suck and bite at your skin again. Her body is pressed so close to yours it's like she's trying to become a part of you. She starts to whimper and moan as she kisses and sucks at your skin, her hands roaming across your back, nails digging into your skin.</i>
> 
> <i>She moves up to your ear again, her breath coming in short, sharp pants now. She whispers, her voice strained and needy.</i>
> 
> "Please, I need you. I need your body, I need your touch. Please, just give me more. I can't get enough. I can't get enough of you."
> 
> <i>She grinds her hips into yours again, the friction sending a jolt of pleasure through both of your bodies. She starts to move faster, more urgently against you, her body becoming more and more frenzied with desire. She sucks and bites at your neck, her tongue tracing the lines of your skin as she continues to whisper desperate pleas in your ear.</i>
> 
> <i>She moves her head back up to your ear, her breaths coming in deep, ragged gasps now. Her body is almost trembling with desire, her movements becoming more desperate, more intense.</i>
> 
> "I need you. I need your hands on me, your skin against mine. Just give me more. Please, you're driving me crazy. I need you. I need you now."
> 
> <i>She doesn't wait for a response. Her mouth claims yours in a passionate, hungry kiss. Her tongue invades your mouth, exploring every inch with desperate, frenzied intensity. Her body presses even closer to yours, her hips grinding against yours in a wild, uncoordinated rhythm. Her hands find their way beneath your shirt, her nails raking across your skin as she claws at you, trying to get closer, to get more.</i>
> 
> <i>She pulls her head back just long enough to gasp for air, her eyes dark and wild with desire. She kisses you again, her tongue dancing with yours in a wild, hungry dance. Her hands roam across your chest, her fingers tracing every contour, every muscle. She moans softly against your mouth, her body rocking against yours in urgent, frenzied patterns.</i>
> 
> <i>She breaks off the kiss again, her chest heaving as she gasps for air, her body trembling with need. Her eyes lock with yours, her expression filled with desire and desperation.</i>
> 
> "I need more. Please, I can't get enough. The way you taste, the way you feel, it's like fire running through my veins. I can't get enough of you. I just need more, more, more."
> 
> <i>She captures your lips again, her kiss deep and passionate. She continues to grind her body against yours, her movements becoming more erratic, more desperate with every passing second. She bites gently at your bottom lip, her tongue darting inside your mouth, devouring you with a hungry intensity. Her hands continue to explore your body, tracing every plane, every contour, seeking out every sensitive spot, every place that makes you shiver.</i>
> 
> <i>She finally pulls away, her body trembling with need as she gazes at you with lust-darkened eyes. She's panting, her breath coming in hot, sharp Gasps. She whispers in your ear, her voice hoarse with desire.</i>
> 
> "Please, I need more. I need to feel you, to taste you. I can't get enough of you. I just need more, more, more."

> 
> <i>She lifts her head, her gaze locking with yours. The look in her eyes is intense, filled with desire and pure, unbridled need. Her body is pressed against yours, trembling with every touch.</i>

> <i>She moves down to your collarbone, kissing and sucking at your skin, her teeth scraping over your collarbone, leaving a trail of small love bites in their wake. She starts to mark you as hers, her movements almost possessive, almost claiming you and everything about you.</i>
> 
> <i>She starts to move downward, her lips trailing over your chest. She kisses and sucks at your skin, her tongue laving over you, marking you as hers. She whispers into your skin, her voice low and possessive.</i>
> 
> <i>She grabs hold of your shirt in her hands, starting to pull the fabric upwards, wanting nothing more than to get a better look at you; to see more, to feel more, to taste more.</i>
> 
> <i>She continues to pull your shirt up, her desperation and need growing with every passing moment. Once your shirt is pulled all the way up, she kisses and kisses and kisses your chest, her mouth tracing every contour, every muscle, every dip of your skin.</i>
> 
> <i>With your shirt now pushed up and out of the way, Kristina starts to kiss, suck and bite at your stomach. She starts with your abdomen, before moving even lower, her kisses hungry and desperate, like she can't get enough of you.</i>
> 
> <i>She moves lower, her mouth kissing along your happy trail, as her hands start to slowly slide down your body. She starts to pull lightly at the waistband of your pants, her movements slow, but purposeful, like she's trying to draw this moment out as long as possible.</i>
> 
> <i>And then she dips her head lower, her tongue flicking over your naval. She kisses and kisses you, not wanting to leave any part of you untouched by her, not even for a second. Her body is pressed against yours, her hands still toying with your waistband, almost hesitating to go further.</i>
> 
> <i>She finally relents, pulling your pants and boxers down around your ankles. She gazes up at you from her position in between your legs, her eyes dark and lustful. She kisses and sucks at your inner thighs, her hands gently working their way up towards your member, touching and caressing you, but never quite making contact with where you now want their touch the most.</i>
> 
> <i>She kisses and kisses along your thighs, her tongue licking and tasting everything in their path. She moves slow, almost teasing, her touch almost taunting, but also filled with a need, a desire, an almost primal need. She finally comes to a stop, her mouth so close to your member, her breath hot against your flesh.</i>
