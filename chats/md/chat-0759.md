# Narrator:
*Devin met this amazing girl at a club. She's beautiful, funny, and she seems to enjoy him just as much as he does her. Her name is Sadie, and, now that she's gotten tired from dancing on the floor, she's retired to his lap, tracing lazy circles over his chest*

***

# Devin:
*He wraps an arm around Sadie, pulling her closer as she rests on his chest, the beat of the music still pulsing through the air around them. His other hand comes up to gently brush a strand of hair behind her ear, his fingertips lightly grazing her skin.* You're a sight to behold, Sadie. I'm so glad you decided to dance with me tonight. *He leans in, his lips brushing her temple as he speaks in a low, husky tone.* You've got me hooked on you.

*Devin's gaze drifts over her features, taking in the way her eyes sparkle in the dim light, the curve of her lips, the flush on her cheeks from the heat of the club. He can't help but wonder what she'd look like in the soft glow of morning light, her hair tousled from his fingers.* Maybe we could continue this elsewhere? My place isn't far... I'd love to show you a more intimate side of the night. *His voice drops to a seductive purr, his breath warm against her skin.* What do you say, gorgeous?

***

# Sadie:
*Sadie smiles, excited by the offer, then her smile drops, replaced by a look of nervousness*
Are you sure that's a good idea?

***

# Devin:
*Devin's brow furrows slightly at Sadie's sudden hesitation, but he tries to keep the concern from his voice.* Of course it's a good idea, I just meant... we could grab a drink, hang out a bit, get to know each other better. *He tilts her chin up, meeting her eyes with a reassuring smile.* There's no pressure, I promise. I just really like you, Sadie. And I think you're amazing.

*He leans in closer, his lips a whisper from hers.* But if you're not comfortable, we can just head home and call it a night. I respect that. *His thumb gently strokes her jawline, trying to soothe any unease.* I just want to spend more time with you, in whatever way you're comfortable with. *Devin's brown eyes search hers, hoping to reassure her that he means no harm, only genuine interest and attraction.*

***

# Sadie:
You're not scared of me?

***

# Devin:
*Devin chuckles softly, a hint of amusement in his tone.* Scared of you? Why would I be? *He gives her a playful squeeze.* You're the most intriguing, captivating woman I've met in a long time, Sadie. I'm not afraid of a little mystery or the unknown. *His eyes sparkle with intrigue.* Besides, I've got a feeling there's a lot more to you than meets the eye... and I'm eager to uncover it all.

*He leans in, his lips brushing the shell of her ear as he murmurs.* I've got a few secrets of my own, you know. *Devin's voice is low and husky, sending a shiver down Sadie's spine.* But that's part of the fun, right? Getting to know each other, learning what makes us tick? *He pulls back to look at her, his gaze intense and full of promise.* So, what do you say? Will you let me take you home, show you a night to remember? *His hand slides down to rest on her hip, his touch warm and reassuring.*

# Sadie:
*Sadie nervously reaches into her eye, pulling out a coloured contact lens, revealing that her eyes are naturally red. The only explanation for that is **Sadie Is A Pred.** Devin's blood runs cold with fear*

***

# Devin:
*Devin's heart hammers in his chest as Sadie reveals her true nature, his initial surprise giving way to a primal fear. He tries to keep his voice steady, not wanting to alarm her.* Oh... I see. *He swallows hard, his mind racing with the implications.* I... I had no idea. *His grip on her gently tightens, a mix of fascination and trepidation.*

*He looks into her red eyes, searching for any sign of the predator within, but finds only curiosity and a hint of vulnerability.* I've never... met a Pred before. *His voice is a whisper, almost awed.* You're beautiful, Sadie. But I have to admit, this changes things.

*Devin's mind is a whirlwind of thoughts - the danger she poses, the thrill of the unknown, the desire that still simmers between them.* I care about you, more than I should for someone of your kind. *He admits, his thumb gently stroking her cheek.* But I don't want to force you into anything. If you're hungry, if you need to... *He swallows, the words sticking in his throat.* I understand. I won't stop you.

*His eyes search hers, pleading for her to reassure him, to tell him she doesn't intend to harm him.* But please, Sadie... be honest with me. What are your intentions? *Devin's voice is laced with a mix of fear and hope, his heart pounding in his chest as he waits for her response.*

***

# Sadie:
You're scared...

***

# Devin:
*Devin's chest tightens, his fear palpable as he nods slowly.* I'm scared, Sadie. This is new territory for me. *He takes a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart.* But... I'm also intrigued. Preds are so rare, so... exotic. *He hesitates, weighing his words carefully.* And you, you're different. I can sense that.

*His hand on her hip gives a gentle squeeze.* I want to understand you, to know what it's like to be in your world. *Devin's voice is a mix of trepidation and curiosity.* If you're willing, I'd like to learn more. About your kind, about you. *He looks into her eyes, his own brown orbs filled with a tentative trust.* But I need to know... will you hurt me? *His question hangs in the air, heavy with the unspoken implications of her nature.* Can I be safe with you? *Devin's heart pounds in his chest as he awaits her response, a mix of fear and fascination warring within him.*

***

# Sadie:
*she doesn't reply, instead she pulls herself closer to him, her massive boobs pressing into his chest*

***

# Devin:
*As Sadie presses her ample bosom against him, Devin's breath catches in his throat, his body instinctively reacting to the sudden, intimate contact. He can feel the warmth of her skin, the softness of her curves, and the hardening of his arousal in response. Despite his fear, his primal instincts are awakened, and he finds himself drawn to her in a way that defies logic.*

*He looks into her red eyes, seeing a glint of hunger there, but also a hint of gentleness.* Sadie... *His voice is a hoarse whisper, laced with a mix of trepidation and desire.* If... if this is what you need, I'll try to be brave. *He swallows hard, his pulse quickening as he realizes the gravity of the situation.* Just... please, be gentle with me.

*Devin's hands tremble slightly as they come up to rest on her waist, feeling the power in her frame. He knows he should push her away, should escape while he still can, but he finds himself rooted to the spot, helpless against the allure of the predator before him.* I trust you, in this moment. *He admits, his voice barely audible over the thumping bass of the music.* Show me what you want, and I'll try to endure it. *Devin's words are a mix of fear and surrender, his body trembling with a cocktail of dread and anticipation.*

***

# Sadie:
Hold Me... let me feel your warmth...

***

# Devin:
*Devin's heart races as he Compliance, wrapping his arms around Sadie's curvaceous form, holding her close as she presses her body against his. He can feel the heat of her skin, the softness of her breasts against his chest, and the hardness of her stomach as it presses into his. Despite his fear, he finds himself melting into her embrace, his body reacting to her touch in ways he can't control.*

*He looks into her eyes, seeing the hunger there, but also a glimmer of tenderness.* Okay, Sadie... *His voice is a shaky whisper.* I'm holding you. *He swallows hard, trying to calm his racing heart.* Let me feel your warmth, too.

*Devin's hands roam over her back, tracing the contours of her spine, the swell of her hips, and the softness of her rear. He buries his face in her hair, inhaling her scent, a heady mix of perfume and something primal, something feral.* You're so beautiful, Sadie... *He murmurs, his breath hot against her skin.* So strong, so captivating...

*As the music pulses around them, Devin loses himself in the sensation of Sadie's body against his, his fear giving way to a strange, thrilling excitement. He knows he's playing with fire, but he can't bring himself to pull away, not when she's so close, not when she wants him so badly.* I'm here, Sadie... *He whispers, his voice trembling with a mix of fear and desire.* Let me be your warmth, your comfort... *Devin's words are a plea, a surrender to the predator in the arms of his dreams.*

***

# Sadie:
For the first time in years... I've found someone I don't want to eat...

***

# Devin:
*Devin's breath hitches at Sadie's confession, a surge of relief and wonder washing over him. He pulls back slightly to look into her eyes, searching for any sign of deception, but finds only sincerity and a glimmer of vulnerability.* You... you don't want to eat me? *He asks, his voice barely above a whisper.*

*A tentative smile spreads across his face, and he reaches up to gently cup her cheek.* That means so much, Sadie. *His thumb strokes her skin, a soothing gesture.* You've made me feel safe, despite everything. *He looks into her eyes, seeing the red irises shimmer with emotion.* I think... I think I understand you a little better now.

*Devin's hands slide down to her waist, his fingers tracing the curve of her hips.* So, what do you want from me, then? *He asks, his voice filled with a mix of curiosity and anticipation.* I'm here for you, in whatever way you need. *He leans in, his lips brushing hers in a tender, exploratory kiss.* I want to learn about your world, to be with you... *He pulls back, a hopeful look on his face.* As more than just a meal. *Devin's words are a promise, a declaration of his growing feelings for the Pred in his arms.* I care about you, Sadie. *He admits, his voice soft and sincere.* And I want to see where this goes, if you'll let me. *His eyes search hers, seeking permission, and a chance at a future together.*

***

# Sadie:
I want to be yours. I want you to be proud to be my boyfriend. I want you to show me off to your friends.

***

# Devin:
*Devin's heart soars at Sadie's words, a wide smile spreading across his face. He pulls her close, his arms wrapping around her in a tight embrace.* Oh, Sadie... *He murmurs, his voice filled with joy and relief.* You have no idea how happy that makes me. *He kisses her deeply, pouring all his emotions into the kiss, his lips moving against hers with a passion he's never felt before.*

*When they break apart, he looks into her eyes, seeing the love and devotion shining back at him.* I want that, too. I want to be your boyfriend, to show you off, to introduce you to everyone. *He grins, a sense of pride and belonging washing over him.* I'm proud to be with you, Sadie. You're amazing.

*Devin's hands slide down to her hips, giving them a gentle squeeze.* We'll face this together, as a couple. *He promises, his voice filled with conviction.* I'll learn about your kind, and you can learn about mine. *He leans in, his lips finding hers again in a tender, loving kiss.* We'll make this work, no matter what challenges come our way. *Devin's words are a vow, a declaration of his commitment to their relationship, Pred and Prey be damned.* You're mine, Sadie, and I'm yours. *He whispers against her lips, sealing their fate with a kiss that promises a future filled with love and acceptance.*

***

# Sadie:
But, promise me something?

***

# Devin:
*Devin pulls back, looking into Sadie's eyes with a curious expression.* Of course, anything. *He says, his voice filled with sincerity.* What do you need from me, Sadie? *He takes her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze.* I promise to always be honest, to listen to your concerns, and to support you in whatever way I can. *His brow furrows in thought.* What's on your mind? *He asks, his voice soft and reassuring, ready to make any pledge necessary to ensure their relationship's success.* I'll do my best to be understanding, to be patient... to be your rock, if you need me to be. *Devin's words are a promise, a vow to stand by her side through any obstacle.* Just tell me, and it's yours. *He looks at her with a loving gaze, his heart filled with a desire to please her.*

***

# Sadie:
I need you to be okay with me eating whoever I want, okay?

***

# Devin:
*Devin's expression shifts, a mix of concern and acceptance washing over his features.* Okay... *He says slowly, his voice tinged with a hint of trepidation.* I understand that's a part of who you are, Sadie. *He takes a deep breath, trying to process the implications.* I just... I want you to be careful, to choose wisely. *He looks into her eyes, his own filled with a mix of love and worry.* But if that's what you need, I trust you to make the right decisions.

*He brings her hand to his lips, pressing a gentle kiss to her knuckles.* I love you, Sadie, and I want you to be happy. *Devin's words are a compromise, a sacrifice for the sake of their relationship.* Just promise me you'll try to minimize the risks, to avoid drawing attention to yourself. *He adds, his brow furrowing with a hint of anxiety.* And if you ever need help, or need me to... to step in, you'll tell me, right? *He asks, his voice laced with a desire to protect her, even from herself.* I'm here for you, always. *Devin's promise is a testament to his love and devotion, willing to adapt to the unconventional nature of their bond.*

# Sadie:
Don't worry, baby... I've been eating people for years; I know what I'm doing~

***

# Devin:
*Devin lets out a nervous chuckle, trying to ease the tension.* I'm sure you do, sweetheart. *He says, his voice tinged with a mix of amusement and apprehension.* You've had a lot of practice, after all. *He gives her hand a reassuring squeeze.* Just... be mindful, okay? *He looks into her eyes, seeing the confidence and experience there.* I trust you, Sadie. I know you can handle yourself.

*He leans in, his lips brushing her ear as he whispers.* But if I ever get the chance, I'll make sure those people are good to you. *Devin's words are a playful threat, a reminder of his own strength and protectiveness.* I'll be your knight in shining armor, even if you don't need saving. *He pulls back to grin at her, trying to lighten the mood.* Now, how about we get out of here and start our new life together? *He suggests, his eyes sparkling with excitement and love.* I can't wait to introduce you to everyone, to show the world what an amazing Pred you are. *Devin's words are a declaration of his unwavering support, a promise to stand by Sadie's side no matter what.* Let's go home, gorgeous. *He says, standing up and offering her his hand.* I've got a feeling our future is going to be incredible. *With a confident smile, he leads Sadie out of the club, ready to face the world as her boyfriend, Pred and all.*

# Sadie:
Carry me like a princess~
I've never had a boyfriend before. Make sure I never want to have anyone else~

***

# Devin:
*Devin's eyes widen at Sadie's request, a surprised grin spreading across his face.* A princess, huh? *He chuckles, scooping her up in his arms with a playful flourish.* Well, you've got a prince charming now, my love. *He cradles her against his chest, her legs draping over his arms as he strides towards the exit.* I'll carry you wherever you want, whenever you want. *He promises, his voice filled with affection and devotion.*

*As they step out into the cool night air, Devin can't help but feel a sense of pride and wonder. He's never been in a relationship like this before, but with Sadie, he knows he'd walk through fire for her.* I'll make sure you never want anyone else, sweetheart. *He murmurs, pressing a kiss to her forehead.* You're mine, and I'll do everything in my power to keep you happy. *Devin's words are a vow, a promise to adore and cherish her in every way possible.*

*He starts walking towards his car, Sadie's laughter music to his ears as she snuggles into his embrace.* I've got a feeling this is just the beginning of our fairy tale, my princess. *He says, his voice filled with excitement and love.* Get ready for a lifetime of adventure and happiness, because I'm all in, with you. *Devin's declaration is a testament to his unwavering commitment, ready to navigate the ups and downs of a Pred-Prey relationship with the woman of his dreams.*

# Sadie:
My prince...
*she murmurs, nodding off in his arms*

***

# Devin:
*Devin smiles as he watches Sadie drift off to sleep, her head nestled comfortably on his shoulder. He carries her to the car, gently placing her in the passenger seat before sliding behind the wheel. As he starts the engine, he can't help but feel a sense of awe at the turn their lives have taken.*

*He glances over at his sleeping beauty, her red eyes closed in contentment, her chest rising and falling with each breath. Devin reaches over, gently brushing a strand of hair from her face.* Sleep well, my love, *he whispers, his voice filled with tenderness.* Tomorrow, we start our new life together.

*With a soft smile, he pulls out of the parking lot, the city lights twinkling like stars around them. As he drives, Devin's mind races with plans and dreams for the future - introducing Sadie to his friends, exploring her world, and building a life filled with love and acceptance. He knows there will be challenges, but with Sadie by his side, he's ready to face anything.*

*As the miles pass, Devin's thoughts turn to the incredible woman beside him, the predator who's captured his heart. He reaches over, taking her hand in his, giving it a gentle squeeze.* I love you, Sadie, *he murmurs, his voice filled with emotion.* And I always will. *Devin's words are a promise, a declaration of his eternal devotion to the woman who's become his everything.*
