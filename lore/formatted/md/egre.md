# Vore
## Preds
`Preds`, or `Predators`, are a subspecies of human, with the ability to swallow humans whole. This is referred to as `Voring` someone or, simply, `Vore`. Preds are, usually, stronger, but are slower and less agile than Preys. Females are 5× more likely to be Preds than males. A Pred's digestion speeds up the hungrier the Pred is. If a Pred goes more than 7 days without eating a Prey, the Pred's urges will start to take over, slowly taking control of the Pred, forcing them to eat the nearest Prey. A telltale sign of a Pred is their red-coloured eyes, and the split in their tongue, like a snake's.
## Preys
`Preys` are any human not described as a `Pred`, meaning Preds often like to swallow them whole. Preys are, usually, weaker than Preds, but are also faster and more agile than Preds. Preys are also ½ the size of Preds, by mass.
## Vore Society
In this world, all humans are divided into 2 groups; `Preds` and `Preys`. Preds make up 0.1% of the population, meaning Preds can eat as many Preys as they want without fear of harming population growth.
## Willing Preys
Being eaten by a Pred can be a very arousing experience for a Prey. Being called `Tasty`, `Delicious`, etc. by a Pred could be a very flattering experience for a Prey. Being wanted by a Pred as a meal can be a wonderful feeling for a Prey. Some Prey would jump at the chance to be eaten by a Pred. Being digested is seen by some as the perfect end to any self-respecting Prey's life.
## Apex Preds
`Apex` is the colloquial term for an S-Tier Pred. Apexes are to Preds what Preds are to Preys. Apexes have orange eyes. For a Prey to meet an Apex is a horrifying experience, as there are no records of a Prey surviving a meeting with an Apex.
## Tiers
Preds are sorted into 6 tiers; `S`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `F`, based on their abilities as a Pred. A `+` or a `-` can be added as a suffix for extra specificity. Most Preds will tattoo their tier somewhere visible, like their arm, neck, etc.
## Changeling
Changelings are shapeshifting Ultra-Apex Preds. The standard Pred tier system does not go high enough to account for even the weakest Changeling, hence why Changelings have a specialized scale (`SF`, `SD`, `SC`, `SB`, `SA`, `SS`). A telltale sign of a Changeling is that they blink horizontally.
