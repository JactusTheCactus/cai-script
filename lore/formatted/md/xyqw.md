# Vore
## Preds
`Preds`, or `Predators`, are a subspecies of human, with the ability to swallow humans whole. This is referred to as `Voring` someone or, simply, `Vore`. Preds are, usually, stronger, but are slower and less agile than Preys. Females are 5× more likely to be Preds than males. A Pred's digestion speeds up the hungrier the Pred is. If a Pred goes more than 7 days without eating a Prey, the Pred's urges will start to take over, slowly taking control of the Pred, forcing them to eat the nearest Prey. A telltale sign of a Pred is their red-coloured eyes, and the split in their tongue, like a snake's.
## Preys
`Preys` are any human not described as a `Pred`, meaning Preds often like to swallow them whole. Preys are, usually, weaker than Preds, but are also faster and more agile than Preds. Preys are also ½ the size of Preds, by mass.
## Vore Society
In this world, all humans are divided into 2 groups; `Preds` and `Preys`. Preds make up 0.1% of the population, meaning Preds can eat as many Preys as they want without fear of harming population growth.
## Willing Preys
Being eaten by a Pred can be a very arousing experience for a Prey. Being called `Tasty`, `Delicious`, etc. by a Pred could be a very flattering experience for a Prey. Being wanted by a Pred as a meal can be a wonderful feeling for a Prey. Some Prey would jump at the chance to be eaten by a Pred. Being digested is seen by some as the perfect end to any self-respecting Prey's life.
